FAQ: Engine API

   If what you're looking for isn't answered here, check out our
   [72]general FAQ

Bots and text analysis

     * (BUTTON) Can I build a chatbot using Infermedica's Engine API?
       Yes. You can build a symptom checker chatbot using Infermedica's
       Engine API. While you need to handle the conversation flow on your
       own, you can rely on our language technology to read symptoms
       mentioned in user messages. Also, our [73]/diagnosis endpoint will
       provide you with questions that the user may be asked directly
       (such as "Is your headache severe?").
       We have a special endpoint for reading symptoms mentioned in user
       messages ([74]read more about the /parse endpoint) and [75]an
       exemplary implementation of chatbot (opens in a new tab) . This
       service is currently available only in English.
     * (BUTTON) Can I build a chatbot in a language other than English
       using Infermedica's Engine API?
       Yes. You can build a symptom checking chatbot using Infermedica's
       Engine API. While you need to handle the conversation flow on your
       own, you can rely on our language technology to read symptoms
       mentioned in user messages. Also, our /diagnosis endpoint will
       provide you with questions that the user may be asked directly
       (such as "Is your headache severe?").
       We have a special endpoint for reading symptoms mentioned in user
       messages (read more about the [76]/diagnosis endpoint). This
       service is currently available only for English.
     * (BUTTON) Can Infermedica's Engine API analyze the symptoms
       mentioned in a text?
       Yes, we have a special endpoint for reading observations mentioned
       in user messages. [77]Read more about NLP.
     * (BUTTON) Can I build a voice application (e.g Alexa skill) using
       Infermedica Engine API?
       Yes! Our [78]Natural Language Processing technology makes it
       possible to understand observations in a user's messages. We don't
       provide voice recognition or text-to-speech, but you can use a
       commercially available platform, such as Alexa Voice Service, Baidu
       Deep Voice, Google Speech, or Yandex Speechkit.
       We would be happy to spread the word about your Infermedica-based
       voice application. If you wish, feel free to share!
     * (BUTTON) What is the difference between the /search and /parse
       endpoints?
       The search endpoint assumes that you are looking for one particular
       observation -- a symptom or risk factor -- and returns a list of
       candidate matches. The whole input text is treated as a query for
       one observation. The behavior is customized for searching (possibly
       partial) user input. It is best for implementing search boxes in
       the UI.
       The /parse endpoint gives you access to our NLP technology. You can
       use it to read what a user said in their own words, describing one
       or more observations. It is best suited for reading user messages
       that were sent to a chatbot or an unstructured description of the
       patient's observations in the health records. This endpoint returns
       a list of captured mentions of observations, each of them assigned
       with an id code and understood status (present or absent).

Technical

     * (BUTTON) Which programming languages does Infermedica support?
       Infermedica's Engine API is a language-independent, standard web
       service that can be easily integrated with any existing HTTP client
       using virtually all of the popular programming languages and
       frameworks.
     * (BUTTON) What type of questions can be returned by the API?
       The /diagnosis endpoint returns a structure containing a few lines
       of useful information. One of the items returned is the most
       relevant question given the current knowledge about the person
       being examined. This is the question we suggest asking the user
       next unless you decide that enough questions have already been
       asked. This question has three possible types:
          + single - a yes/no question about a single symptom (e.g. "Do
            you have a headache?"); when the user answers this type of
            question, you should send back all the evidence collected thus
            far, including the status of the symptom that has just been
            learned (present, absent or unknown)
          + group_single - a single-choice question about a group of
            related symptoms (e.g. "What is your body temperature?"); with
            single-choice questions it is sufficient to send back the
            answer chosen by the user (the ID of the answer with the
            present status) together with the evidence collected in the
            earlier stages
          + group_multiple - a multiple-choice question about a group of
            related symptoms (e.g. "What is the character of your
            headache?"); any number of symptoms (including none) can be
            sent as present; if you are sure that the others should be
            interpreted as absent, please send them explicitly as such;
            you may also send some symptoms as unknown to prevent getting
            questions about them (this makes sense if the user didn't
            answer conclusively).
     * (BUTTON) Why am I getting 403 responses to my API call?
       If you are getting error 403 in response to your API call, it's
       most likely because you have exceeded your monthly limit of API
       requests. Should this happen, [79]contact us.
       Learn more about [80]Infermedica's Engine API errors by clicking
       the link. If that doesn't help, please [81]contact us.
     * (BUTTON) How do I disable group questions?
       When using the /diagnosis endpoint, you can disable group questions
       to make sure the API returns only single questions by sending
       "disable_groups": true in "extras". Here is an example:
       JSON
    {
      "age": 50,
      "sex": "male",
      "evidence": [
        {"id": "s_98", "choice_id": "present"}
      ],
      "extras": {"disable_groups": true},
    }
       (BUTTON)
     * (BUTTON) How do I send someone's weight and height to Infermedica's
       Engine API?
       This is not available directly in the current API version, but you
       could compute BMI on your side and add one of the corresponding
       BMI-related risk factors to the evidence about the current case
       before sending it along when calling /diagnosis.
       There are two such risk factors:
          + p_6 - BMI below 19
          + p_7 - BMI over 30
       If the computed value of the person's BMI exceeds 30, add "p_7":
       "present". If the value is lower than 19, add "p_6": "present". If
       the value falls within the healthy range (19 < BMI < 30), it's best
       to add both of these risk factors as absent to prevent the API from
       asking about BMI.
     * (BUTTON) How does the NLP endpoint (/parse) work?
       This endpoint gives access to our in-house Natural Language
       Processing technology. It allows you to capture symptoms and risk
       factors mentioned in unstructured text descriptions, such as user
       messages sent to a chatbot or a text description extracted from a
       medical record.
       Our language technology is also able to understand some typical
       ways of expressing negation (e.g. "I don't have a headache" or
       "lymph nodes are not enlarged").
       Each captured mention is assigned an ID code and a status (present
       or absent), which makes it compatible with our /diagnosis endpoint.
       This way you can send the captured evidence directly for assessment
       and learn current predictions, the triage level, and what question
       to ask next.
       This service works best with simple phrases or sentences (such as
       "I have a terrible headache and back pain" or "feeling sick"). It
       may be unable to understand complex stories (descriptions of
       accidents, complications, and general descriptions involving a
       series of events whose mutual relationship in time is relevant).
       Our technology is based on automated syntactic analysis and
       matching techniques tailored to the medical domain. We are
       constantly improving the quality of this service.
       [82]See an exemplary implementation of chatbot leveraging our NLP
       engine (opens in a new tab).
     * (BUTTON) The NLP endpoint (/parse) doesn't understand my input.
       What do I do?
       We're doing all we can to make this service as accurate as
       possible, but no NLP technology is perfect, including ours. The
       service works best with simple phrases and sentences (such as "I
       have a sore throat" or "no vomiting but feeling sick"). It's not
       good at understanding complex stories, in particular descriptions
       of accidents or complications after diseases.
       If you feel that it's not working properly for a case that it
       should be able to handle, please [83]contact us. While we can't
       promise that it will understand every possible description
       correctly, we're constantly improving the technology and such
       feedback is very important to us.
     * (BUTTON) A call to /diagnosis returns a single condition. Why?
       This is due to security measures. For all API calls containing less
       than three reported observations, the list of conditions will be
       limited to a single condition. For all calls with more than two
       observations (either present or absent), the API will return the
       full ranking of relevant conditions.
       In all real life situations, you will want to collect more than two
       pieces of evidence (e.g. two symptoms, two answers). Given that, we
       believe this API behavior is not a limitation for any proper
       application.
     * (BUTTON) Does Infermedica log calls clients make to the API and the
       responses provided? Can clients provide Infermedica with some sort
       of information so that the Infermedica team can see what went wrong
       in a client's submission to the API?
       Infermedica can try to recreate an interview and check what
       happened if the client uses Interview-id. Interview-id is mentioned
       in the [84]developer's documentation and in Infermedica's help
       center several times, should the client's tech team need help
       implementing it.
