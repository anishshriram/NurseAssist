   Interview-Id

Interview-Id

   The Interview-Id is a unique, random, immutable string that defines a
   given patient's single interview with Infermedica API.

   A single interview with Infermedica API

   In this context, "a single interview" may span across multiple calls to
   the API and usually refers to a full symptom-checking interview - from
   the moment the user initiates the interview to when they get all of the
   required recommendations and decide to finish the interaction.

   The Interview-Id value should be passed to Infermedica API during each
   request via the HTTP header: Interview-Id.

Who creates an Interview-Id?

   Whenever a patient starts an interview with Infermedica API, a single
   Interview-Id should be generated. It's the API client's responsibility
   to generate that Interview-Id.

Format of an Interview-Id

   Infermedica does not enforce any particular form, but we recommend
   following these rules:
     * The Interview-Id should be unique to a single interview. In other
       words, no interviews should share the same Interview-Id.
     * The Interview-Id should stay unchanged throughout the entirety of a
       single interview with the API. In other words, a single interview
       should be marked with a single Interview-Id from start to finish.
     * The Interview-Id should be random (i.e. "meaningless") - it should
       not convey any business/medical knowledge nor should it be any kind
       of PII (patient's ID, name, etc.). In fact - on its own, it should
       convey no information whatsoever.

   Putting all that together - the best practice is to use some kind of
   [74]UUID (opens in a new tab) generation tool to create Interview-Ids.

Example requests

   Let's assume you generated an Interview-Id using the UUID tool as
   follows: d083e76f-3c29-44aa-8893-587f3691c0c5

   Then each call to the API should add it to the Interview-Id HTTP
   header.

   E.g. call to the /search endpoint:
   cURL
curl "https://api.infermedica.com/v3/search?phrase=abdominal%20pain&age.value=30
&sex=male" \
  -X "GET" \
  -H "App-Id: XXXXXXXX" \
  -H "App-Key: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Interview-Id: d083e76f-3c29-44aa-8893-587f3691c0c5" \
  -H "Dev-Mode: true"

   (BUTTON)

   and a call to the /diagnosis endpoint:
   cURL
curl "https://api.infermedica.com/v3/diagnosis" \
  -X "POST" \
  -H "App-Id: XXXXXXXX" \
  -H "App-Key: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Interview-Id: d083e76f-3c29-44aa-8893-587f3691c0c5" \
  -H "Dev-Mode: true" \
  -d '{"sex":"male", "age":{"value": 30}, "evidence":[{"id":"s_100", "choice_id"
:"present"}]}'

Example use of Interview-Id

    1. The patient initiates an interview with an Infermedica API-based
       product.
    2. The API client generates a new Interview-Id.
    3. The interview begins. Each of the mentioned requests to the API
       should contain the Interview-Id HTTP header. What the exact
       boundaries of a single interview are is dependent on your specific
       use-case. Here is our example:
          + several calls to the /search endpoint to find chief complaints
            (initial symptoms).
          + a call to the /suggest endpoint containing all of the initial
            evidence found in point 1.
          + multiple calls to the /diagnosis endpoint, starting with the
            initial evidence and answers to the /suggest questions. Each
            call results in the user being asked a question. After which,
            the evidence list that is included in these calls is expanded
            to include the user's answer to the previous question and a
            subsequent call is made, getting back another question. This
            process repeats until a stop condition is met.
          + additional calls to the recommendation endpoints such as
            /triage, /recommend_specialist etc.
    4. The interview ends.
          + The Interview-Id should be stored by the client.
          + The Interview-Id should be "forgotten" - meaning that it
            should never be reused for another interview.
