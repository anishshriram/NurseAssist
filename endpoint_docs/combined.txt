   Engine API
   Build your solution
   Diagnosis

Diagnosis

   The /diagnosis endpoint is the core of the Infermedica API. Using a
   patient's sex, age, and medical evidence (including symptoms and risk
   factors), it suggests possible causes and generates questions to drive
   an interview similar to one a doctor would have with a patient.
   !!!

   The /diagnosis endpoint in the API is not a substitute for independent
   medical advice nor does it offer a diagnosis per se. The information
   presented by Infermedica's API should not be considered medical advice.
   The API is not intended or designed to be used to diagnose, treat,
   cure, or prevent any disease. The information that Infermedica's API
   provides should not be used for therapeutic purposes or as a substitute
   for a health professional's advice.

Stateless API

   The Infermedica API is stateless. Since the API does not track the
   state or progress of interviews, each request to /diagnosis must
   contain all the information gathered to that point about a given case.
   You can't send only the answer to the most recent question returned
   from /diagnosis; your application must store sex, age, initial
   evidence, and all previous answers, and resend them each time, along
   with the most recent answer.

Interview flow

   To carry out a symptom assessment interview with a patient, you will
   need multiple calls to /diagnosis. Before the first request, the
   patient's sex, age, and initial evidence must be collected (e.g. the
   patient's chief complaint and relevant risk factors). The response to
   the first request will contain an interview question that should be
   presented to the patient. The patient's answer should then be added to
   the list of already collected evidence. The process should continue in
   the following manner:
     * send a request to /diagnosis with the updated evidence list,
     * ask the patient the question returned from /diagnosis,
     * add the patient's answer to the existing evidence list,
     * repeat the steps.

   This process can continue for as long as necessary. The should_stop
   attribute suggests when the interview should be considered finished.
   Our engine takes into account several factors when determining this,
   including the interview length and the confidence it has in the
   rankings. It's possible to continue the interview beyond this point if
   needed, but we highly recommend honoring this attribute for most
   use-cases. In general, the number of questions answered and the
   probability of the top conditions in the rankings should be considered
   when deciding when to stop the interview.

Request

   The /diagnosis endpoint responds to POST requests containing a JSON
   object that describes a single medical case, e.g.
   cURL
curl "https://api.infermedica.com/v3/diagnosis" \
  -X "POST" \
  -H "App-Id: XXXXXXXX" \
  -H "App-Key: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" \
  -H "Interview-Id: d083e76f-3c29-44aa-8893-587f3691c0c5" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "sex": "female",
    "age": {
      "value": 25
    },
    "evidence": [
      {"id": "s_47", "choice_id": "present", "source": "initial"},
      {"id": "s_22", "choice_id": "present", "source": "initial"},
      {"id": "p_81", "choice_id": "absent"}
    ]
  }'

   (BUTTON)

Sex and age

   The sex and age attributes are two required elements of every request
   to /diagnosis. Under the hood, sex and age are used to automatically
   instantiate corresponding risk factors that may alter the base
   prevalence of medical conditions in Infermedica's model.

   The sex attribute indicates the patient's biological sex and can have
   one of two possible values: female or male.

   The age is composed of two attributes:
     * age.unit - optional parameter:
          + It can be either year or month,
          + If not specified, it defaults to year,
          + If age is provided in months, specifying age.unit as month is
            required. This is especially important for children under 1
            year of age, where age must be provided in months.
     * age.value - required parameter:
          + If age.unit is year, provide a value between 1 and 130,
          + If age.unit is month, provide a value between 0 and 1560.

   JSON
"sex": "female",
"age": {
    "value": 11,
    "unit": "month"
}

   (BUTTON)

   If age.value is missing, invalid, or set to 0 when age.unit is year (or
   not specified), you will get a 400 Bad Request [106]error.

Evidence

   The evidence list is the most important part of each request to
   /diagnosis. While evidence is technically an optional attribute, to
   receive a non-empty response there must be at least one present symptom
   added to your evidence list. Please note that sending only risk factors
   or only absent symptoms might not be sufficient to start the interview.

   Each piece of evidence should be sent as a simple JSON object with two
   required attributes: id and choice_id. Optionally, a source attribute
   can also be added (see corresponding section below).
   JSON
"evidence": [
  {"id": "s_98", "choice_id": "present"}
]

   (BUTTON)

   The id attribute indicates an observed symptom or risk factor.

   The choice_id attribute represents the state of given evidence and can
   have one of 3 values: present, absent or unknown. Please note that
   absent and unknown cannot be used interchangeably, as their
   mathematical meanings are different.

   Omitting id or choice_id or providing invalid values will yield a 400
   Bad Request [107]error .

Indicating evidence source

   Another key important attribute of evidence is called source. It allows
   the user to mark the exact stage of the interview that the given
   evidence was sent at. Thanks to this, the engine can provide more
   relevant interviews and, as a result, a better final list of most
   probable conditions as well as improved triage recommendations.

   We highly recommend adding the source attribute if any of the following
   applies to your case:
     * any symptoms are reported by user as initial evidence (see:
       [108]Gathering initial evidence),
     * any questions about symptoms or risk factors are prompted or
       predefined (see: [109]Common risk factors),
     * /suggest endpoint is used,
     * /red_flags endpoint used.

   !!!

   Keep in mind that, while the source attribute is not strictly required
   to get a response from the /diagnosis endpoint, setting it properly is
   required for the interview as a whole to function properly. source is
   also needed for Infermedica to be able to help with an implementation.
   As such, it is best to treat the source attribute as though it were
   required.

   This attribute takes one of the following values:
     * "source": "initial" - evidence reported by user,
     * "source": "suggest" - evidence from /suggest endpoint,
     * "source": "predefined" - evidence predefined separately from the
       dynamic interview, should be applied to all custom evidence (not
       calculated in /diagnosis or /suggest),
     * "source": "red_flags" - evidence from /suggest with red_flags
       method or /red_flags endpoint,
     * no value - for evidence gathered during the dynamic interview, the
       source attribute should be entirely omitted.

   For example:
   JSON
{
  "sex": "female",
  "age": {
    "value": 45
  },

   An evidence source is required for every piece of evidence that was not
   inferred in /diagnosis, otherwise the quality of the interview could be
   strongly decreased.

Gathering initial evidence

   Interviews are most effective when they are started with some
   meaningful initial evidence. The search space of available symptoms is
   very wide, so the statistical inference engine needs a place to start.
   Due to this, you should aim for at least 2-3 initial present symptoms.
   Adding additional symptoms, as well as absent ones, and risk factors is
   also helpful.

   There are many ways to gather initial evidence:
     * using the [110]/search endpoint to implement autocomplete widgets
       that let users enter and select their observations,
     * using the [111]/parse endpoint to analyze free-text (either
       pre-existing, like a patient record, or entered by the user, like a
       chat message) and extract mentions of observations from it,
     * building a predefined list of [112]common or particularly relevant
       observations for users to choose from,
     * building a human body avatar with each body part mapped to the
       predefined list of observations for the user to select,
     * using the [113]/suggest endpoint to find observations that have
       often been selected by other users with similar health problems,
     * allowing users to enter their laboratory test results.

   Based on our experience from numerous deployments, it is both important
   and challenging to design this initial step in a way that will
   encourage users to provide enough data to begin the interview.

Indicating initial evidence

   The initial evidence, i.e. evidence reported by the user before the
   start of the interview, should be marked as "source": "initial", e.g.
   JSON
"evidence": [
  {"id": "s_98", "choice_id": "present", "source": "initial"}
]

   (BUTTON)

   There are two consequences of marking evidence as initial:
     * The inference engine can better understand the progress of the
       interview, which supports the [114]stop recommendation feature
     * Conditions unrelated to the initial evidence are only included in
       the conditions ranking when their probability is sufficiently high.
       This makes the interview results more focused on the chief
       complaints.

   In most cases, the initial evidence reported by a patient is related to
   the conditions in the rankings. However, we've noticed that some users
   provide initial evidence but later deny all of its related symptoms,
   causing the engine to broaden its search space and return unrelated
   conditions. Designating evidence as initial prevents this.

   Although there are use cases where it is impossible to use the
   "source": "initial" attribute, and it is therefore optional, we highly
   recommend using this attribute whenever possible, especially if you are
   relying on stop recommendations.

Common risk factors

   In our medical knowledge base, risk factors can be chronic conditions
   (e.g. diabetes), lifestyle habits (e.g. smoking), geographical
   locations (e.g. South America) or events (e.g. a head injury or insect
   bite). Risk factors alone are not sufficient information to start an
   interview, but their presence may greatly impact the base prevalence of
   various conditions. For example, if a patient reports a high fever and
   chills, it's most likely the flu. However, if the same symptoms are
   present but we know that the patient has recently returned from some
   exotic location, the engine will broaden its search towards infectious
   tropical diseases. Similarly, when a patient reports a headache, it is
   important to know if they have recently suffered an injury or trauma.

   Although /diagnosis may return questions about risk factors, when
   implementing a symptom checker we recommend asking the patient about
   common risk factors before the actual interview begins. This helps to
   steer the interview in the right direction and to reduce its length.

   One way to gather initial risk factors is to use [115]/suggest in
   relevant risk factors mode. This is recommended when working with
   [116]demographic-based risk factors or [117]evidence-based risk
   factors. However, some risk factors are not handled by the /suggest
   algorithm, notably those related to geographical location (either
   residence in or recent travel to):
     * p_13 - United States or Canada
     * p_14 - Central or South America
     * p_15 - Europe
     * p_16 - Northern Africa
     * p_17 - Central Africa
     * p_18 - Southern Africa
     * p_19 - Australia or Oceania
     * p_20 - Russia, Kazakhstan, or Mongolia
     * p_21 - Middle East
     * p_236 - Asia excluding Middle East, Russia, Kazakhstan and Mongolia

   As geographical risk factors (which can substantially improve the
   quality of an interview and its results) can only ever be gathered via
   the addition of extra pre-interview risk factor questions, it is
   strongly encouraged to add these to the application.

   Every piece of evidence which is not gathered with API methods (e.g.
   /search, /parse, /suggest, or /diagnosis), should be marked with
   "source": "predefined", e.g.
   JSON
"evidence": [
  {"id": "p_13", "choice_id": "present", "source": "predefined"},
  {"id": "p_14", "choice_id": "present", "source": "predefined"},
  {"id": "p_19", "choice_id": "present", "source": "predefined"}
]

   Hardcoding should be used sparingly. Overuse of hardcoding could lead
   to unforeseen errors, code duplication, and other maintenance issues.

Weight and height

   The previous version of the Infermedica API allowed weight and height
   to be sent along with sex and age. This is no longer supported, but
   weight-related risk factors are available in our default model and can
   be included as evidence instead. There are two such risk factors:
     * p_6 - Low BMI
     * p_7 - High BMI

   When a patient's weight and height are available, you can compute their
   [118]BMI (opens in a new tab) in your application and add the
   appropriate risk factor as present to the evidence list in a /diagnosis
   call, e.g.
   JSON
{
  "sex": "male",
  "age": {
    "value": 45
  },
  "evidence": [
    {"id": "p_7", "choice_id": "present"}
  ]
}

   (BUTTON)

   When the patient's BMI falls within a healthy range (between 19 and
   30), you may include both of the above risk factors as absent.
   Otherwise /diagnosis may return a question about BMI when such
   information would be relevant in the symptom assessment process.

Request extras

   The extras attribute may contain additional options that control
   various aspects of the endpoint. Please refer to [119]the section below
   for a detailed explanation.

Response

   The response contains 5 sections:
     * question - next interview question to ask the patient
     * conditions - ranking of possible medical conditions
     * should_stop - signals when to stop the interview (optional - this
       attribute will be returned only if initial evidence is indicated)
     * has_emergency_evidence - indicates if reported evidence appears
       serious and the patient should go to an emergency department
     * extras - usually empty, may contain additional or experimental
       attributes.

Question

   The question attribute represents an interview question that can be
   presented to the user.

   The question attribute can also have a null value. This means that
   either no present symptom has been provided as initial evidence or, in
   the rare case of an extremely long interview, that there are no more
   questions to be asked.

Question types

   There are three main types of questions enabled by default, with each
   requiring slightly different handling. A fourth can be enabled via the
   [120]enable_symptom_duration option.

single

   The single type represents simple Yes/No/Don't know questions, e.g.
   JSON
"question": {
  "type": "single",
  "text": "Does the pain increase when you touch or press on the area around you
r ear?",
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "s_476",
      "name": "Pain increases when touching ear area",
      "choices": [
        {
          "id": "present",
          "label": "Yes"
        },
        {
          "id": "absent",
          "label": "No"
        },
        {
          "id": "unknown",
          "label": "Don't know"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "extras": {}
}

   (BUTTON)

   When the user answers a question of the single type, exactly one object
   with the id of the item and selected choice_id should be added to the
   evidence list of the next request, e.g.
   JSON
"evidence": [
  ...
  {"id": "s_476", "choice_id": "present"}
]

   (BUTTON)

group_single

   The group_single type represents questions about a group of related but
   mutually exclusive symptoms, of which the patient should choose exactly
   one, e.g.
   JSON
"question": {
  "type": "group_single",
  "text": "What is your body temperature?",
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "s_99",
      "name": "Between 99.5 and 101 °F (37 and 38 °C)",
      "choices": [
        {
          "id": "present",
          "label": "Yes"
        },
        {
          "id": "absent",
          "label": "No"
        },
        {
          "id": "unknown",
          "label": "Don't know"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "s_100",
      "name": "Above 101 °F (38 °C)",
      "choices": [
        {
          "id": "present",
          "label": "Yes"
        },
        {
          "id": "absent",
          "label": "No"
        },
        {
          "id": "unknown",
          "label": "Don't know"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "extras": {}
}

   (BUTTON)
   !!!

   For a question of the group_single type, exactly one object with the id
   of the selected item and choice_id set to present should be added to
   the evidence list of the next request, with all other items omitted,
   e.g.
   JSON
"evidence": [
  ...
  {"id": "s_99", "choice_id": "present"}
]

   (BUTTON)

group_multiple

   The group_multiple type represents questions about a group of related
   symptoms where any number of them can be selected, e.g.
   JSON
"question": {
  "type": "group_multiple",
  "text": "How would you describe your headache?",
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "s_25",
      "name": "Pulsing or throbbing",
      "choices": [
        {
          "id": "present",
          "label": "Yes"
        },
        {
          "id": "absent",
          "label": "No"
        },
        {
          "id": "unknown",
          "label": "Don't know"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "s_604",
      "name": "Feels like \"stabbing\" or \"drilling\"",
      "choices": [

          "label": "No"
        },
        {
          "id": "unknown",
          "label": "Don't know"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "s_23",
      "name": "Feels like pressure around my head",
      "choices": [
        {
          "id": "present",
          "label": "Yes"
        },
        {
          "id": "absent",
          "label": "No"
        },
        {
          "id": "unknown",
          "label": "Don't know"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "extras": {}
}

   (BUTTON)
   !!!

   An object should be added to the evidence list of the next request for
   each item of a group_multiple question. Any available choice_id is
   allowed. Omitting any item may cause the same question to be returned
   by the API again.

Question extras

   Questions can be configured by using [121]extra request options. For
   instance, it's possible to [122]disable sensitive content or
   [123]question groups, [124]add additional explanations, or change to
   [125]third-person mode. Selecting a different [126]interview mode can
   change which questions are asked during the interview.

Conditions

   Each response contains a conditions attribute holding a list of
   possible conditions sorted by their estimated probability.

   Each condition in the rankings is represented by a JSON object with the
   following attributes: id, name, name_common, and probability.

   While name and common_name attributes are returned for convenience, any
   additional information about a given condition can be retrieved from
   the /conditions/{id} [127]endpoint using the id attribute.
   Alternatively, you can pass [128]include_condition_details in extras to
   include condition details in the /diagnosis response.

   The probability attribute is a floating point number between 0 and 1
   indicating a match between reported evidence and conditions in the
   model.

   Please note that the condition rankings may be empty [] if there is no
   evidence or in rare cases where the combination of evidence isn't
   associated with any specific condition.

Ranking limiting

   To prevent reverse-engineering of our models, we limit the number of
   conditions returned from /diagnosis.

   Most notably, if the list of evidence is shorter than 3, only one
   condition will be returned. In the case of longer evidence lists,
   /diagnosis can return up to 20 conditions, depending on the probability
   distribution of the conditions in the rankings.

Patient Education

   For some conditions, patient education articles may be available, as
   shown by the has_patient_education attribute in [129]condition_details
   being set to true. Patient education articles are documents compiled by
   our medical experts that contain detailed information about a
   condition's causes, the usual diagnostic process, possible care methods
   etc., and can be presented to a patient to give them a deeper
   understanding of the conditions that are returned in the interview
   process. For more information, please refer to the [130]Patient
   Education section.

Stop recommendation

   Once enough information has been collected, the interview should be
   stopped. To help you decide when to stop asking further questions,
   we've provided the stop condition recommendation. This feature uses a
   heuristic algorithm which takes into account the number of questions
   asked and the confidence of the current analysis' results.
   !!!

   The stop recommendation will be available only if you indicated at
   least one initial evidence (see [131]Gathering initial evidence).

   If should_stop is true, the stop condition has been reached. False
   means that the interview should be continued. If the attribute is not
   available at all, either you haven't specified the initial evidence or
   the stop recommendation could not be proposed.
   !!!

   It is possible to finish the interview earlier if
   has_emergency_evidence is true even if should_stop is false. This is
   acceptable when the urgency of the case is sufficient for the end-user
   and quick treatment is needed. However, we recommend continuing the
   interview until the should_stop attribute is true to achieve the most
   accurate results regarding the list of most probable conditions and/or
   triage level. Please note that in some cases, even if
   has_emergency_evidence is true, the triage level could still be
   increased from emergency to emergency_ambulance.

Response extras

   The extras attribute in response object is empty by default, but can be
   used to return additional or experimental attributes for custom models
   or selected partners.

Extras

   Both the request and response objects may contain an extras attribute.
   In requests, extras may include additional or experimental options to
   control the behavior of the inference engine. These options can also
   influence other endpoints that accept the same request object, such as
   [132]/suggest or [133]/triage.
   ¹

   Note that providing invalid or non-existent options will not produce an
   error.

enable_symptom_duration

   This option introduces a new type of question and an additional
   evidence attribute to support specifying the duration of an
   observation. To enable it:
   JSON
"extras": {
  "enable_symptom_duration": true
}

   (BUTTON)

   This option introduces the duration question type, which differs from
   other types by replacing the items attribute with evidence_id in the
   question object:
   JSON
"question": {
  "type": "duration",
  "text": "How long have you had stomach pain?",
  "evidence_id": "s_13",
  "extras": {}
}

   (BUTTON)

   When responding to a duration type question, the answer should add a
   single object to the evidence list. This object must use the
   evidence_id value as its id and include a duration object, apart from
   the typical choice_id. The duration object consists of two attributes:
     * value - a required numeric value that specifies the duration,
     * unit - a required duration unit, one of: week, day, hour, or
       minute.

   JSON
"evidence": [
  {
    "id": "s_13",
    "choice_id": "present",
    "duration": {
      "value": 2,
      "unit": "day"
    }
  }
]

   (BUTTON)

   The enable_symptom_duration option also allows for the use of the
   duration object with initial evidence (observations marked with
   "source": "initial"). While this addition is optional, including
   duration information for initial symptoms can enhance the inference
   process and potentially shorten the duration of the interview.

interview_mode

   This option allows you to control the behavior of the question
   selection algorithm. The interview mode may have an influence on the
   duration of the interview as well as the sequencing of questions.

   Currently, the following interview modes are available:
     * default - suitable for symptom checking applications, providing the
       right balance between duration of interview and accuracy of the
       presented results,
     * triage - suitable for triage applications that prioritize providing
       a safe triage level rather than attaining the highest possible
       accuracy for the final list of most probable conditions. If
       accuracy is a priority, this mode should not be used. The interview
       process is also shorter in cases where a patient is suspected of
       having a condition that requires emergency-level support as the
       interview is then stopped and the results are shown right away.

   JSON
"extras": {
  "interview_mode": "triage"
}

   (BUTTON)
   !!!

   Interview modes can only be used when [134]5-level triage is enabled.

enable_explanations

   This optional functionality is designed to provide additional
   descriptions, enhancing user understanding of each question's meaning.
   JSON
"extras": {
  "enable_explanations": true
}

   (BUTTON)

   When enabled, explanations can be attached to questions or question
   items. For single type questions, explanations are added at the
   question level. In group questions, they are attached to individual
   question items. Two additional attributes are included at both levels:
     * explication - additional context or description of the observation
       in question,
     * instruction - a list of steps to confirm the symptom's presence.

   JSON
"question": {

   Explanations are optional and may not be present for every question or
   question item. In such cases, null is returned.

enable_third_person_questions

   With this option, the interview can be configured to allow users to
   answer questions on behalf of someone else. By setting this option to
   true, each question from the /diagnosis endpoint will be formulated in
   the third person. As interviews for individuals under the age of 18
   have to be performed by someone else, if the age selected is under 18
   then the questions will be asked in third person.
   JSON
"extras": {
  "enable_third_person_questions": true
}

   (BUTTON)
   !!!

   If the model in use does not support third person questions, a 400 Bad
   Request error will be returned with the message: "message": "Third
   person question not supported."

include_condition_details

   Enabling this option adds an additional condition_details object to
   each condition in the conditions list. This object contains attributes
   that have the same values and meanings as those in the output of the
   [135]/conditions endpoint:
     * icd10_code
     * category
     * prevalence
     * acuteness
     * severity
     * triage_level
     * hint
     * has_patient_education

   JSON
"extras": {
  "include_condition_details": true
}

   (BUTTON)
   JSON

  {
    "id": "c_255",
    "name": "Tetanus",

      "has_patient_education": false
    }

Advanced options

   The options listed below can be useful in certain use cases, but are
   generally not recommended as they may have a negative impact on
   interview quality.

disable_intimate_content

   This option is used to exclude "intimate" concepts, including those
   related to sexual activity.
   JSON
"extras": {
  "disable_intimate_content": true
}

   (BUTTON)

   There are several safeguards to ensure appropriate presentation of
   content tagged as "intimate". If disable_intimate_content is not
   included, intimate content may be returned in responses. That said,
   questions considered very sensitive in nature - especially those about
   sexual behavior - will still require the user's explicit consent. This
   consent is facilitated via the Consent to a sexual interview symptom
   (s_2652). Setting the disable_intimate_content option to true ensures
   that no content tagged as "intimate" is included.

   Please note that the criteria for what constitutes "intimate" content
   can change over time. For the most up-to-date information regarding
   this classification, we recommend contacting Infermedica.

disable_groups

   Activating this option configures the /diagnosis endpoint to return
   only single type questions, effectively disabling questions of the
   group_single and group_multiple types. This can be particularly useful
   in interfaces where implementing group questions is challenging, such
   as in chatbots or voice assistants. However, as a general guideline, it
   is recommended to keep group questions enabled for more accurate and
   shorter interviews.
   JSON
"extras": {
  "disable_groups": true
}

   (BUTTON)

Deprecated options

   These options are maintained for backward compatibility only and should
   not be used in new implementations.

disable_adaptive_ranking

   Enabling this option reverts to the legacy method of displaying the
   ranking of possible conditions, used before the implementation of the
   current adaptive ranking system.
   JSON
"extras": {
  "disable_adaptive_ranking": true
}

   (BUTTON)

enable_triage_3

   Activating this option switches back to the legacy 3-level triage
   system. For detailed information, please refer to the [136]/triage
   endpoint documentation.
   JSON
"extras": {
  "enable_triage_3": true
}

   (BUTTON)

Alternative use cases

   While an interactive symptom checker (e.g. mobile application, chatbot
   or voice assistant) in which the user is presented with a series of
   medical questions is the most recognizable use case, there are other
   valid uses of the /diagnosis endpoint.

   The /diagnosis endpoint can be used to provide context-aware decision
   support, e.g. when paired with /parse to analyze patient notes, or
   integrated into an EHR-like system to provide instant insights about
   possible causes or subsequent care steps. In such cases, only one call
   to /diagnosis is usually required, as all the evidence is known in
   advance and there is no direct contact with the patient.

   When /diagnosis is used with [137]custom models, there are even more
   possibilities. We've seen /diagnosis used to qualify patients for
   clinical trials, to assess the risks of post-operational complications,
   and to support operators of medical call centers.

Explain

   The /explain endpoint allows you to see how reported observations are
   linked with the final list of most probable conditions. For example,
   you can use this endpoint in the results page to display "reasons for"
   and "reasons against" particular conditions. It also provides insights
   into why certain conditions were considered by the inference engine and
   it increases the credibility of the results presented to the end-user.
   ¹

   Trial access to Infermedica API limits calls to the /explain endpoint.
   [73]Contact us for more plan options.

Request

   The /explain endpoint responds to POST requests and accepts a JSON
   object similar to that used for the /diagnosis endpoint. In addition to
   the standard request structure, an attribute named target should be
   added, which is assigned the ID of the condition you want explained.

   To prevent reverse-engineering attempts, the maximum allowed size of
   evidence list is set to 60.

       positively linked with the given condition but were reported as
       absent ("reasons against"),
     * unknown_evidence - a list of observations that may be linked with
       the given condition but were reported as unknown.

Target condition not ranked in adaptive ranking

   The /explain endpoint may return 400 Bad Request response in situations
   where the target condition is not included in the conditions' ranking.
   This behavior has been introduced to prevent reverse-engineering
   attempts. The probability threshold is dynamic and may depend on
   several factors but, generally speaking, a high probability target
   should be explainable. Always check the response code before attempting
   to display the response of the /explain request. Implementations should
   rely on error codes, not the specific content within an error message
   as the specific content could change.

FAQ: Engine API

   If what you're looking for isn't answered here, check out our
   [72]general FAQ

Bots and text analysis

     * (BUTTON) Can I build a chatbot using Infermedica's Engine API?
       Yes. You can build a symptom checker chatbot using Infermedica's
       Engine API. While you need to handle the conversation flow on your
       own, you can rely on our language technology to read symptoms
       mentioned in user messages. Also, our [73]/diagnosis endpoint will
       provide you with questions that the user may be asked directly
       (such as "Is your headache severe?").
       We have a special endpoint for reading symptoms mentioned in user
       messages ([74]read more about the /parse endpoint) and [75]an
       exemplary implementation of chatbot (opens in a new tab) . This
       service is currently available only in English.
     * (BUTTON) Can I build a chatbot in a language other than English
       using Infermedica's Engine API?
       Yes. You can build a symptom checking chatbot using Infermedica's
       Engine API. While you need to handle the conversation flow on your
       own, you can rely on our language technology to read symptoms
       mentioned in user messages. Also, our /diagnosis endpoint will
       provide you with questions that the user may be asked directly
       (such as "Is your headache severe?").
       We have a special endpoint for reading symptoms mentioned in user
       messages (read more about the [76]/diagnosis endpoint). This
       service is currently available only for English.
     * (BUTTON) Can Infermedica's Engine API analyze the symptoms
       mentioned in a text?
       Yes, we have a special endpoint for reading observations mentioned
       in user messages. [77]Read more about NLP.
     * (BUTTON) Can I build a voice application (e.g Alexa skill) using
       Infermedica Engine API?
       Yes! Our [78]Natural Language Processing technology makes it
       possible to understand observations in a user's messages. We don't
       provide voice recognition or text-to-speech, but you can use a
       commercially available platform, such as Alexa Voice Service, Baidu
       Deep Voice, Google Speech, or Yandex Speechkit.
       We would be happy to spread the word about your Infermedica-based
       voice application. If you wish, feel free to share!
     * (BUTTON) What is the difference between the /search and /parse
       endpoints?
       The search endpoint assumes that you are looking for one particular
       observation -- a symptom or risk factor -- and returns a list of
       candidate matches. The whole input text is treated as a query for
       one observation. The behavior is customized for searching (possibly
       partial) user input. It is best for implementing search boxes in
       the UI.
       The /parse endpoint gives you access to our NLP technology. You can
       use it to read what a user said in their own words, describing one
       or more observations. It is best suited for reading user messages
       that were sent to a chatbot or an unstructured description of the
       patient's observations in the health records. This endpoint returns
       a list of captured mentions of observations, each of them assigned
       with an id code and understood status (present or absent).

Technical

     * (BUTTON) Which programming languages does Infermedica support?
       Infermedica's Engine API is a language-independent, standard web
       service that can be easily integrated with any existing HTTP client
       using virtually all of the popular programming languages and
       frameworks.
     * (BUTTON) What type of questions can be returned by the API?
       The /diagnosis endpoint returns a structure containing a few lines
       of useful information. One of the items returned is the most
       relevant question given the current knowledge about the person
       being examined. This is the question we suggest asking the user
       next unless you decide that enough questions have already been
       asked. This question has three possible types:
          + single - a yes/no question about a single symptom (e.g. "Do
            you have a headache?"); when the user answers this type of
            question, you should send back all the evidence collected thus
            far, including the status of the symptom that has just been
            learned (present, absent or unknown)
          + group_single - a single-choice question about a group of
            related symptoms (e.g. "What is your body temperature?"); with
            single-choice questions it is sufficient to send back the
            answer chosen by the user (the ID of the answer with the
            present status) together with the evidence collected in the
            earlier stages
          + group_multiple - a multiple-choice question about a group of
            related symptoms (e.g. "What is the character of your
            headache?"); any number of symptoms (including none) can be
            sent as present; if you are sure that the others should be
            interpreted as absent, please send them explicitly as such;
            you may also send some symptoms as unknown to prevent getting
            questions about them (this makes sense if the user didn't
            answer conclusively).
     * (BUTTON) Why am I getting 403 responses to my API call?
       If you are getting error 403 in response to your API call, it's
       most likely because you have exceeded your monthly limit of API
       requests. Should this happen, [79]contact us.
       Learn more about [80]Infermedica's Engine API errors by clicking
       the link. If that doesn't help, please [81]contact us.
     * (BUTTON) How do I disable group questions?
       When using the /diagnosis endpoint, you can disable group questions
       to make sure the API returns only single questions by sending
       "disable_groups": true in "extras". Here is an example:
       JSON
    {
      "age": 50,
      "sex": "male",
      "evidence": [
        {"id": "s_98", "choice_id": "present"}
      ],
      "extras": {"disable_groups": true},
    }
       (BUTTON)
     * (BUTTON) How do I send someone's weight and height to Infermedica's
       Engine API?
       This is not available directly in the current API version, but you
       could compute BMI on your side and add one of the corresponding
       BMI-related risk factors to the evidence about the current case
       before sending it along when calling /diagnosis.
       There are two such risk factors:
          + p_6 - BMI below 19
          + p_7 - BMI over 30
       If the computed value of the person's BMI exceeds 30, add "p_7":
       "present". If the value is lower than 19, add "p_6": "present". If
       the value falls within the healthy range (19 < BMI < 30), it's best
       to add both of these risk factors as absent to prevent the API from
       asking about BMI.
     * (BUTTON) How does the NLP endpoint (/parse) work?
       This endpoint gives access to our in-house Natural Language
       Processing technology. It allows you to capture symptoms and risk
       factors mentioned in unstructured text descriptions, such as user
       messages sent to a chatbot or a text description extracted from a
       medical record.
       Our language technology is also able to understand some typical
       ways of expressing negation (e.g. "I don't have a headache" or
       "lymph nodes are not enlarged").
       Each captured mention is assigned an ID code and a status (present
       or absent), which makes it compatible with our /diagnosis endpoint.
       This way you can send the captured evidence directly for assessment
       and learn current predictions, the triage level, and what question
       to ask next.
       This service works best with simple phrases or sentences (such as
       "I have a terrible headache and back pain" or "feeling sick"). It
       may be unable to understand complex stories (descriptions of
       accidents, complications, and general descriptions involving a
       series of events whose mutual relationship in time is relevant).
       Our technology is based on automated syntactic analysis and
       matching techniques tailored to the medical domain. We are
       constantly improving the quality of this service.

     * (BUTTON) The NLP endpoint (/parse) doesn't understand my input.
       What do I do?
       We're doing all we can to make this service as accurate as
       possible, but no NLP technology is perfect, including ours. The
       service works best with simple phrases and sentences (such as "I
       have a sore throat" or "no vomiting but feeling sick"). It's not
       good at understanding complex stories, in particular descriptions
       of accidents or complications after diseases.
       If you feel that it's not working properly for a case that it
       should be able to handle, please [83]contact us. While we can't
       promise that it will understand every possible description
       correctly, we're constantly improving the technology and such
       feedback is very important to us.
     * (BUTTON) A call to /diagnosis returns a single condition. Why?
       This is due to security measures. For all API calls containing less
       than three reported observations, the list of conditions will be
       limited to a single condition. For all calls with more than two
       observations (either present or absent), the API will return the
       full ranking of relevant conditions.
       In all real life situations, you will want to collect more than two
       pieces of evidence (e.g. two symptoms, two answers). Given that, we
       believe this API behavior is not a limitation for any proper
       application.
     * (BUTTON) Does Infermedica log calls clients make to the API and the
       responses provided? Can clients provide Infermedica with some sort
       of information so that the Infermedica team can see what went wrong
       in a client's submission to the API?
       Infermedica can try to recreate an interview and check what
       happened if the client uses Interview-id. Interview-id is mentioned
       in the [84]developer's documentation and in Infermedica's help
       center several times, should the client's tech team need help
       implementing it.

   Interview-Id

Interview-Id

   The Interview-Id is a unique, random, immutable string that defines a
   given patient's single interview with Infermedica API.

   A single interview with Infermedica API

   In this context, "a single interview" may span across multiple calls to
   the API and usually refers to a full symptom-checking interview - from
   the moment the user initiates the interview to when they get all of the
   required recommendations and decide to finish the interaction.

   The Interview-Id value should be passed to Infermedica API during each
   request via the HTTP header: Interview-Id.

Who creates an Interview-Id?

   Whenever a patient starts an interview with Infermedica API, a single
   Interview-Id should be generated. It's the API client's responsibility
   to generate that Interview-Id.

Format of an Interview-Id

   Infermedica does not enforce any particular form, but we recommend
   following these rules:
     * The Interview-Id should be unique to a single interview. In other
       words, no interviews should share the same Interview-Id.
     * The Interview-Id should stay unchanged throughout the entirety of a
       single interview with the API. In other words, a single interview
       should be marked with a single Interview-Id from start to finish.
     * The Interview-Id should be random (i.e. "meaningless") - it should
       not convey any business/medical knowledge nor should it be any kind
       of PII (patient's ID, name, etc.). In fact - on its own, it should
       convey no information whatsoever.

   Putting all that together - the best practice is to use some kind of
   [74]UUID (opens in a new tab) generation tool to create Interview-Ids.

Example requests

   Let's assume you generated an Interview-Id using the UUID tool as
   follows: d083e76f-3c29-44aa-8893-587f3691c0c5

   Then each call to the API should add it to the Interview-Id HTTP
   header.

   E.g. call to the /search endpoint:
   cURL
curl "https://api.infermedica.com/v3/search?phrase=abdominal%20pain&age.value=30
&sex=male" \
  -X "GET" \
  -H "App-Id: XXXXXXXX" \
  -H "App-Key: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Interview-Id: d083e76f-3c29-44aa-8893-587f3691c0c5" \
  -H "Dev-Mode: true"

   (BUTTON)

   and a call to the /diagnosis endpoint:
   cURL
curl "https://api.infermedica.com/v3/diagnosis" \
  -X "POST" \
  -H "App-Id: XXXXXXXX" \
  -H "App-Key: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Interview-Id: d083e76f-3c29-44aa-8893-587f3691c0c5" \
  -H "Dev-Mode: true" \
  -d '{"sex":"male", "age":{"value": 30}, "evidence":[{"id":"s_100", "choice_id"
:"present"}]}'

   (BUTTON)

Example use of Interview-Id

    1. The patient initiates an interview with an Infermedica API-based
       product.
    2. The API client generates a new Interview-Id.
    3. The interview begins. Each of the mentioned requests to the API
       should contain the Interview-Id HTTP header. What the exact
       boundaries of a single interview are is dependent on your specific
       use-case. Here is our example:
          + several calls to the /search endpoint to find chief complaints
            (initial symptoms).
          + a call to the /suggest endpoint containing all of the initial
            evidence found in point 1.
          + multiple calls to the /diagnosis endpoint, starting with the
            initial evidence and answers to the /suggest questions. Each
            call results in the user being asked a question. After which,
            the evidence list that is included in these calls is expanded
            to include the user's answer to the previous question and a
            subsequent call is made, getting back another question. This
            process repeats until a stop condition is met.
          + additional calls to the recommendation endpoints such as
            /triage, /recommend_specialist etc.
    4. The interview ends.
          + The Interview-Id should be stored by the client.
          + The Interview-Id should be "forgotten" - meaning that it
            should never be reused for another interview.

   Medical Concepts

Medical concepts

   Our API recognizes various types of medical concepts: symptoms, risk
   factors, and conditions. Symptoms and risk factors are observations
   used to describe patient health problems, and our API can suggest
   conditions as their possible causes.

   To interact with our API, you need to know IDs of medical concepts in
   our [86]knowledge base. We provide endpoints to assist in [87]finding
   these IDs, [88]extracting them from free-text, and obtaining detailed
   information about them, as detailed in this and following sections of
   the documentation.

Endpoints

   For each medical concept type, there are two REST-inspired read-only
   endpoints that support GET requests, returning:
    1. All concepts for a specific age group (e.g.
       /conditions?age.value=25).
    2. Details of a single concept, if available for a specific age group
       (e.g. /conditions/c_1?age.value=25).

   There are also two similar read-only endpoints that allow querying all
   medical concept types together (/concepts and /concepts/{id}).

Specifying age

   Age is a required parameter for both endpoints because it affects the
   list of possible medical concepts. Here's how to specify it:

   age.unit - optional parameter:
     * It can be either year or month,
     * If not specified, it defaults to year,
     * If age is provided in months, specifying age.unit as month is
       required. This is especially important for children under 1 year of
       age, where age must be provided in months.

   age.value - required parameter:
     * If age.unit is year, provide a value between 1 and 130,
     * If age.unit is month, provide a value between 0 and 1560.

   If age.value is missing, invalid, or set to 0 when age.unit is year (or
   not specified), you will get a 400 Bad Request error.

Common attributes

   Each concept is represented by a JSON object with several attributes.
   Some attributes are common to all concepts:
     * id - short and unique concept ID,
     * name - professional medical term for the concept,
     * common_name - alternative name in plain language. If common_name is
       not defined, the API returns name instead.

   Please note that endpoints returning a single concept (e.g.,
   /conditions/c_1?age.value=25) may provide more attributes than those
   returning a list of concepts (e.g., /conditions?age.value=25).

Conditions

   Conditions refer to diseases, and other medical disorders defined in
   our knowledge base. Each condition is assigned a unique ID that begins
   with the c_ prefix and is followed by an integer, e.g. c_26.
   ¹

   You can explore the list of all available [89]adult and [90]pediatrics
   conditions.

Endpoints

    1. The /conditions?age.value={age} endpoint responds to GET requests
       by returning the list of all conditions available for a given age
       group.
       cURL
curl "https://api.infermedica.com/v3/conditions?age.value=25" \

  -H "Interview-Id: d083e76f-3c29-44aa-8893-587f3691c0c5"
       (BUTTON)
    2. The /conditions/{id}?age.value={age} endpoint also responds to GET
       requests, but returns detailed information about a specific
       condition identified by the provided ID. If an invalid ID is
       provided, the endpoint will generate a 404 Not Found error.
       cURL
curl "https://api.infermedica.com/v3/conditions/c_26?age.value=25" \

  -H "Interview-Id: d083e76f-3c29-44aa-8893-587f3691c0c5"
       (BUTTON)

Attributes

   Apart from id, name and common_name, each condition has several
   available attributes:
     * sex_filter - filter indicating conditions only valid for one sex;
       one of both, female, male
     * categories - list of categories the condition belongs to (e.g.
       Dermatology or Gastroenterology)
     * prevalence - approximate estimate of how common the condition is;
       one of very_rare, rare, moderate, common
     * acuteness - comparative distinction between acute and chronic
       conditions; one of chronic, chronic_with_exacerbations,
       acute_potentially_chronic, acute
     * severity - approximate estimate of how severe the condition is; one
       of mild, moderate, severe; can be used together with acuteness to
       alert users, e.g. when an acute and severe condition is suggested
       by /diagnosis
     * hint - brief bit of advice for patients that recommends the steps
       to take if a condition is suspected (e.g. Please consult a
       dermatologist as soon as possible); may be null
     * icd10_code - ICD-10 code of condition; may be null

   Example of a JSON object representing a condition, as returned by
   /conditions/c_26?age.value=25:
   JSON

Symptoms

   Symptoms refer to medical signs and symptoms caused by conditions from
   our knowledge base. IDs of symptoms start with the s_ prefix and are
   followed by an integer, e.g. s_962.

   In our knowledge base, symptoms are organized into a parent-child
   hierarchy. Each symptom can have a single parent symptom assigned, e.g.
   severe headache is a child of headache. Each parent-child relation has
   a type assigned to it. The type of each relation is provided as the
   parent_relation attribute and describes how the child symptom relates
   to its parent; e.g. the child may refer to a specific body location
   (e.g. lumbar back pain or back pain) or an exacerbating factor (e.g.
   abdominal pain increasing after a meal or abdominal pain).

   The parent-child hierarchy of symptoms plays an important role in the
   symptom assessment process:
     * reporting a child symptom automatically adds its parent symptom to
       the evidence list,
     * reporting a parent symptom as absent will inform the engine not to
       ask about its children.

       (BUTTON)
    2. The /symptoms/{id}?age.value={age} endpoint also responds to GET
       requests, but it only returns detailed information about a single
       symptom. If an invalid ID is provided, the endpoint will generate a
       404 Not Found error.

Attributes

   Like conditions, symptoms have several available attributes (including
   id, name and common_name):
     * question - question asking the patient to confirm or deny the
       symptom; may be null for professional symptoms, which are only
       intended for medical providers and are not used in patient
       interviews
     * question_third_person - question in third person form, asking the
       reporter to confirm or deny the symptom; may be null for
       professional symptoms, which are only intended for medical
       providers and are not used in patient interviews
     * sex_filter - filter indicating symptoms only valid for one sex: one
       of both, female, male
     * category - category of the symptom; currently all symptoms are
       assigned to the same category: Signs and symptoms
     * parent_id - ID of the parent symptom; may be null
     * parent_relation - type of relation with the parent symptom: one of
       duration, severity, character, exacerbating_factor,
       diminishing_factor, location, radiation , may be null
     * children - list of child symptoms (symptoms that indicate this
       symptom as their parent) and their relations with this symptom

   Example of a JSON object representing a symptom, as returned by
   /symptoms/s_962?age.value=25:
   JSON
{

Risk factors

   Risk factors represent a patient's chronic conditions (e.g. diabetes),
   lifestyle factors (e.g. smoking), geographical locations (e.g. Central
   Africa) and events (e.g. insect bite or head injury) that may modify
   the baseline probability of conditions. IDs of risk factors start with
   the p_ prefix (as in predisposition) and are followed by an integer,
   e.g. p_28.
   ¹

   You can explore the list of all available [93]adult and [94]pediatrics
   risk factors.

Endpoints

    1. The /risk_factors?age.value={age} endpoint responds to GET requests
       by returning the list of all risk factors available for given age
       group.
       cURL
curl "https://api.infermedica.com/v3/risk_factors?age.value=25" \

       (BUTTON)
    2. The /risk_factors/{id}?age.value={age} endpoint also responds to
       GET requests, but it only returns detailed information about a
       single risk factor. If an invalid ID is provided, the endpoint will
       generate a 404 Not Found error.
       cURL

       (BUTTON)

Attributes

   These are the attributes available for a risk factor (including id,
   name and common_name):
     * question - question asking the patient to confirm or deny the risk
       factor; may be null for risk factors that should be added
       automatically based on sex- or age-related risk factors
     * question_third_person - question in third person form, asking the
       reporter to confirm or deny the risk factor; may be null for risk
       factors that should be added automatically based on sex- or
       age-related risk factors
     * sex_filter - filter indicating risk factors only valid for one sex:
       one of both, female, male
     * category - category of the risk factor; currently all risk factors
       are assigned to the same category: Risk factors

   Example of a JSON object representing a risk factor, as returned by
   /risk_factors/p_28?age.value=25:
   JSON
{
  "id": "p_28",
  "name": "Smoking cigarettes",

Querying all concept types

   There are specific use cases where querying all concept types together
   is practical and efficient, as it eliminates the need for multiple
   requests to individual concept type endpoints. A typical example is
   displaying a comprehensive summary of a completed interview, listing
   all reported symptoms, risk factors, and potential conditions
   identified during the interview. To support these use cases, two more
   general endpoints are available - /concepts and /concepts/{id}.

Endpoints

    1. The /concepts endpoint responds to GET requests by returning a list
       of all available medical concepts.
       Please note that, unlike with other endpoints, the age.value query
       parameter is not supported here.
       cURL
curl "https://api.infermedica.com/v3/concepts" \
  -X "GET" \
  -H "App-Id: XXXXXXXX" \
  -H "App-Key: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" \
  -H "Interview-Id: d083e76f-3c29-44aa-8893-587f3691c0c5"
       (BUTTON)
    2. The /concepts/{id} endpoint also responds to GET requests,
       returning details for a single medical concept. If an invalid ID is
       provided, the endpoint will generate a 404 Not Found error.
       cURL
curl "https://api.infermedica.com/v3/concepts/c_1" \
  -X "GET" \
  -H "App-Id: XXXXXXXX" \
  -H "App-Key: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" \
  -H "Interview-Id: d083e76f-3c29-44aa-8893-587f3691c0c5"
       (BUTTON)

Filtering by types and IDs

   The /concepts endpoint supports filtering concepts by their types and
   IDs, using the types and ids query parameters, respectively. Both
   parameters can accept either a single value or multiple comma-separated
   values. The supported types are condition, symptom, and risk_factor.

   For example, /concepts?types=symptom,condition would return all
   symptoms and conditions, while /concepts?ids=c_1,s_1 would return a
   list containing only the concepts c_1 and s_1. These filters can also
   be used together; for instance, /concepts?ids=c_1,s_1&types=condition
   would return a list with the single concept c_1.

Attributes

   Both /concepts and /concepts/{id} endpoints return only a minimal set
   of common attributes, which include id, name, and common_name, as well
   as:
     * type - the type of the medical concept, which can be one of
       condition, symptom, or risk_factor.

   Example of a JSON object representing a condition, as returned by
   /concepts/c_1:
   JSON
{
  "id": "c_1",
  "type": "condition",
  "name": "Achalasia",
  "common_name": "Achalasia"
}

Python client for Infermedica API 
=================================

Infermedica Python client provides pragmatical access to a medical diagnostic API created by [Infermedica](http://infermedica.com).
Before using the library one must register for a developer account and obtain App-Id and App-Key at [Infermedica Developer Portal](https://developer.infermedica.com). All the API documentation is also available there.


# Installation

Install using `pip`:

```bash
pip install infermedica-api
```

### Quick start

A Quick verification if all works fine:

```python
import infermedica_api

api = infermedica_api.APIv3Connector(app_id="YOUR_APP_ID", app_key="YOUR_APP_KEY")
print(api.info())
```

# Configuration

## API Connectors
The library provides several "API Connectors", that can be used for communication with the Infermedica API. Depending on the required API version and programmatic integration level, a different API Connector should be used. The connectors can be distinguished by two factors. The first factor is the Infermedica API version. The API version is indicated by the connector class name e.g. `APIv3Connector` or `APIv2Connector`. The second factor is the programmatic integration level.  There are three levels available.

Here is a list of currently available API Connectors:
* `BasicAPIv3Connector` - API version: "v3", Integration level: "Basic"
* `APIv3Connector` - API version: "v3", Integration level: "Standard" _(default, recommended)_
* `BasicAPIv2Connector` - API version: "v2", Integration level: "Basic"
* `APIv2Connector` - API version: "v2", Integration level: "Standard"
* `ModelAPIv2Connector` - API version: "v2", Integration level: "Model"

### Basic Connectors
Provides all Infermedica API capabilities as methods, but all methods expose low level HTTP parameters e.g. query params, data or headers. This type of connector should be used if one needs to have full control over the underlying HTTP request content. Each basic connector class is prefixed with "Basic" keyword, e.g. `BasicAPIv3Connector` or `BasicAPIv2Connector`.

Here is an example to illustrate the basic connector method signature:
```python
def diagnosis(data, params=None, headers=None) -> Dict: ...
```

### Standard Connectors
_(default, recommended)_

Standard Connectors are based on Basic Connectors, but provide methods with more detailed attribute signatures. At the same time they operate on basic Python data types like `dict`, `list` or `string`. Therefore, it is easier to understand what is required for each method, and they take care of constructing proper a request to Infermedica API. The standard API connectors do not have s prefix in the class name e.g. `APIv3Connector` or `APIv2Connector`. It is the default and recommended level of integration.

Here is an example to illustrate standard connector method signature:
```python
def diagnosis(evidence, sex, age, age_unit=None, extras=None, interview_id=None) -> Dict: ...
```

### Model Connectors

Model Connectors are even higher level connectors, that are based on Standard Connectors. They expose methods that operate on predefined model classes as their inputs and outputs. Each model connector class is prefixed with the "Model" keyword, e.g. `ModelAPIv2Connector`.

Here is an example to illustrate model connector method signature:
```python
def diagnosis(diagnosis_request: Diagnosis) -> Diagnosis: ...
```


## Configuration types
There are two options to configure the API module, one may choose the most suitable option for related project.

### Local Configuration
Single local API Connector.

```python
import infermedica_api

api = infermedica_api.APIv3Connector(app_id="YOUR_APP_ID", app_key="YOUR_APP_KEY")

print(api.info())
```

Each API Connector constructor takes several configuration parameters, among others:
* `app_id` & `app_key` - Infermedica API credentials, the only two mandatory arguments.
* `model` - Infermedica API language model to be used, [see the docs](https://developer.infermedica.com/docs/v3/basics#models).
* `dev_mode` - Flag that indicates if requests are made on local or testing environment and are not real medical cases.


### Global Configuration
Configuration of one or many global API Connectors, that are easily available everywhere. For this purpose the `configure` function has to be used, to register global configurations. The configuration should be done in a place of the project that is executed on project startup, e.g. in some `__init__.py` file.

The `configure` function takes exactly the same parameters as each API Connector class constructor, but expect few additional optional parameters:
* `alias` - A unique string identifier of the configuration, if not provided configuration is registered as default.
* `default` - In case `alias` is provided, this flag determinate if the configuration should be also registered as the default one. There may be only one default.
* `api_connector` - API connector class to be used for the configuration or just a string with API Connector name, e.g. `"APIv3Connector"` _(default)_

To define a single global connector:

```python
import infermedica_api

infermedica_api.configure(app_id="YOUR_APP_ID", app_key="YOUR_APP_KEY")
```

To define multiple global connectors:

```python
import infermedica_api

# Aliased, default configuration with English language
infermedica_api.configure(
    alias="en",
    default=True,
    app_id="YOUR_APP_ID",
    app_key="YOUR_APP_KEY",
    model="infermedica-en"
)

# Configuration with Polish language
infermedica_api.configure(
    alias="pl",
    app_id="YOUR_APP_ID",
    app_key="YOUR_APP_KEY",
    model="infermedica-pl"
)

# Configuration with English language based on non-default connector
infermedica_api.configure(
    alias="basic-en",
    app_id="YOUR_APP_ID",
    app_key="YOUR_APP_KEY",
    model="infermedica-en",
    api_connector=infermedica_api.BasicAPIv3Connector
)
```

... and then at any place in the project just import the infermedica module and get an already configured API connector through `get_api` function:

```python
import infermedica_api

api = infermedica_api.get_api()  # Get default connector
print(api.info())

api = infermedica_api.get_api("pl")  # Get connector by alias
print(api.info())
```

# Usage

Here is an example of how to use the API to get a list of patient's likely conditions.

```python
import infermedica_api

api = infermedica_api.APIv3Connector(app_id="YOUR_APP_ID", app_key="YOUR_APP_KEY")

# Prepare initial patients diagnostic information.
sex = "female"
age = 32
evidence = [
    {"id": "s_21", "choice_id": "present", "source": "initial"},
    {"id": "s_98", "choice_id": "present", "source": "initial"},
    {"id": "s_107", "choice_id": "present"}
]

# call diagnosis
response = api.diagnosis(evidence=evidence, sex=sex, age=age)

# Access question asked by API
print(response["question"])
print(response["question"]["text"])  # actual text of the question
print(response["question"]["items"])  # list of related evidence with possible answers
print(response["question"]["items"][0]["id"])
print(response["question"]["items"][0]["name"])
print(response["question"]["items"][0]["choices"])  # list of possible answers
print(response["question"]["items"][0]["choices"][0]["id"])  # answer id
print(response["question"]["items"][0]["choices"][0]["label"])  # answer label

# Check the "should_stop" flag
print(response["should_stop"])

# Next update the request and get next question:
evidence.append({
    "id": response["question"]["items"][0]["id"],
    "choice_id": response["question"]["items"][0]["choices"][0]["id"]  # Just example, the choice_id shall be taken from the real user answer
})

# call diagnosis method again
response = api.diagnosis(evidence=evidence, sex=sex, age=age)

# ... and so on, continue the interview and watch for the "should_stop" flag. 
# Once the API returns a "should_stop" flag with the value set to true, the interview questions should stop and you can present the condition results:

# Access list of conditions with probabilities
print(response["conditions"])
print(response["conditions"][0]["id"])
print(response["conditions"][0]["name"])
print(response["conditions"][0]["probability"])
```


## Examples

To see more use cases on how to use the library look at the examples provided. One can easily check out and run examples, first define environmental variables with credentials then run the selected example:

 ```bash
export APP_ID=<YOUR_APP_ID>
export APP_KEY=<YOUR_APP_KEY>

python -m examples.v3.search
python -m examples.v3.parse
python -m examples.v3.symptoms
python -m examples.v3.risk_factors
python -m examples.v3.conditions
python -m examples.v3.lab_tests
python -m examples.v3.concepts
python -m examples.v3.diagnosis
python -m examples.v3.explain
python -m examples.v3.triage
python -m examples.v3.suggest
python -m examples.v3.specialist_recommender
```

## Exceptions

The library provides its own set of exceptions. Here is a list of exceptions, that are related to network communication and account permissions, which can be raised on any of the API Connector method calls:

```
infermedica_api.exceptions.BadRequest
infermedica_api.exceptions.UnauthorizedAccess
infermedica_api.exceptions.ForbiddenAccess
infermedica_api.exceptions.ResourceNotFound
infermedica_api.exceptions.MethodNotAllowed
infermedica_api.exceptions.ServerError
infermedica_api.exceptions.ConnectionError
```

There are also few additional exception that may occur:

* `MissingConfiguration` is raised during the `get_api` call if the API configuration for a given alias was not registered. Or the default API has not been configured, while calling `get_api` without the alias parameter.
* `MethodNotAvailableInAPIVersion` is raised if one tries to use a method from different API version.
* `InvalidSearchConceptType` is raised when the wrong filters are provided to the `search` method.
* `InvalidConceptType` is raised when the wrong concept types are provided to the `concepts` method.
* `InvalidAgeUnit` is raised when the wrong age unit is provided in API v3 Connectors.

   Engine API
   Quickstart

Quickstart

   This short tutorial will get you started with the Infermedica API.
   Subsequent sections of this documentation describe our API in greater
   detail but if you're short on time and have experience with web
   services, this is a quick overview of what working with Infermedica API
   is like.

Setup

   The current version of the Infermedica API is available at
   https://api.infermedica.com/v3. It is a standard web service that
   accepts GET and POST requests. All responses (including error messages)
   use the JSON format. POST requests also take JSON inputs (make sure you
   include the header Content-Type: application/json).

Authentication

   The Infermedica API uses custom HTTP headers to authenticate your
   requests. You will need to add App-Id and App-Key headers to every
   request you make. You can find your credentials on the Apps page (when
   you're logged in). An Interview-Id should also be included. More
   information on Interview-Id can be found [80]here.

First request

   The most important part of our API, given that it handles the symptom
   assessment reasoning, is the /diagnosis endpoint. The endpoint accepts
   POST requests. Apart from sex and age, it requires a list of observed
   evidence (symptoms or risk factors). The list cannot be empty, so first
   you need to gather some initial information about the case.

   Let's assume we have a male patient, aged 30, suffering from severe
   headaches, light sensitivity and a stiff neck. Each observation is
   represented by a unique ID; in this case the symptom IDs are s_1193,
   s_488 and s_418, respectively. There are also ways to search for
   observations and find their IDs (e.g. autocomplete or processing free
   text). Each piece of evidence can have one of three possible states:
   present, absent, or unknown. The state is defined using the choice_id
   attribute.

   In order to achieve the best results and enable more API features, at
   least one of the reported observations should be marked as initial. The
   initial observation is usually the chief complaint that you first
   enter.

   The case described above can be represented with the following JSON
   object:
   JSON
{
  "sex": "male",
  "age": {
    "value": 30
  },
  "evidence": [
    {
      "id": "s_1193",
      "choice_id": "present",
      "source": "initial"
    },
    {
      "id": "s_488",
      "choice_id": "present"
    },
    {
      "id": "s_418",
      "choice_id": "present"
    }
  ]
}

   (BUTTON)

   Your first request to the API could look like this:
   cURL
curl "https://api.infermedica.com/v3/diagnosis" \
  -X "POST" \
  -H "App-Id: XXXXXXXX" \
  -H "App-Key: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Interview-Id: d083e76f-3c29-44aa-8893-587f3691c0c5" \
  -H "Dev-Mode: true" \
  -d '{
    "sex": "male",
    "age": {
      "value": 30
    },

Output

   The response returned from /diagnosis will contain three main sections:
     * the next interview question to ask your user,
     * a ranking of the most probable health conditions,
     * a flag indicating if the interview should be stopped (please note
       that you need to have at least one observation marked as initial to
       see this flag in the output).

   JSON
{
  "question": {...},
  "conditions": [...],
  "should_stop": true,
  ...
}

   (BUTTON)

Question

   The question attribute represents the next interview question that can
   be presented to the user. Questions are follow-ups to already reported
   evidence and can be used to build conversation-like interfaces (symptom
   checkers, chatbots, etc.) that mimic the way a doctor would interview
   their patients.

   In this example, the API generates a question about a symptom called
   Fever (represented by its ID s_98).
   JSON
{
  "question": {
    "type": "single",
    "text": "Do you have a fever?",
    "items": [
      {
        "id": "s_98",
        "name": "Fever",
        "choices": [
          {
            "id": "present",
            "label": "Yes"
          },
          {
            "id": "absent",
            "label": "No"
          },
          {
            "id": "unknown",
            "label": "Don't know"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "extras": {}
  },
  "conditions": [...],
  ...
}

   (BUTTON)
   ¹

   Please note that in some rare cases question can have a null value
   (e.g. when an empty evidence list is sent or when there are no more
   questions to ask).

   There are three possible types of questions:
     * single - a yes/no question about a single symptom (e.g. "Do you
       have a headache?")
     * group_single - single-choice questions about a group of related
       symptoms (e.g. "What is your body temperature?")
     * group_multiple - a multiple-choice question about a group of
       related symptoms (e.g. "What is the character of your headache?");
       any number of symptoms (including none) can be selected.

   ¹

   In some use cases (a chatbot being a popular one), the presentation of
   group questions (group_single or group_multiple) to users might be
   difficult to implement. You can disable group questions to make sure
   the API only returns single questions. To disable group questions,
   please include the following in your JSON object:
"extras": {"disable_groups": true}.

   (BUTTON)

Conditions

   The conditions attribute is a list of health conditions that is related
   to the reported evidence. The list is a ranking sorted by the estimated
   probability of the conditions.
   JSON
{
  "question": {...},
  "conditions": [
    {
      "id": "c_49",
      "name": "Migraine",
      "probability": 0.4532
    },
    {
      "id": "c_151",
      "name": "Meningitis",
      "probability": 0.2942
    },
    {
      "id": "c_55",
      "name": "Tension-type headaches",
      "probability": 0.1787
    }
  ],
  ...
}

   (BUTTON)
   !!!

   Please note that for all API calls containing less than three reported
   observations the list of conditions will be limited to a single
   condition. For all calls with more than two observations (either
   present or absent) the API will return the full ranking of relevant
   conditions. This behavior has been introduced due to security reasons.

Interview flow

   It's possible and sometimes necessary (e.g. when analyzing data without
   user interaction) to settle for the condition ranking that is returned
   by the first call to /diagnosis, but asking the user additional
   questions generated by the API can greatly improve results.

   Following on from the previous example, the condition rankings seem to
   indicate that our patient may suffer from migraines but answering
   additional questions could either help to confirm this suggestion, by
   increasing its probability and ruling out other, more serious health
   problems, such as meningitis, or could prompt a broader list of most
   probable conditions by suggesting other possible causes.

   If the patient were to answer "No" to the question about fever, you
   would need to add the following evidence:
   JSON
{
  "id": "s_98",
  "choice_id": "absent"
}

   (BUTTON)
   ¹

   For single and group_single questions, only one piece of evidence (as
   in the above example) is required. However, please note that
   group_multiple questions require special handling: you need to include
   evidence for each item of the question. You can find more examples on
   the /diagnosis description page.
   !!!

   It's very important to understand that the /diagnosis endpoint is
   stateless. This means that the API does not track the state or progress
   of cases it receives, so with each request you need to send all the
   information gathered about the patient to this point.

   In our case, the next /diagnosis request could include the following
   JSON object:
   JSON
{
  "sex": "male",
  "age": {
    "value": 30
  },
  "evidence": [
    {
      "id": "s_1193",
      "choice_id": "present",
      "initial": "true"
    },
    {
      "id": "s_488",
      "choice_id": "present"
    },
    {
      "id": "s_418",
      "choice_id": "present"
    },
    {
      "id": "s_320",
      "choice_id": "absent"
    }
  ]
}

   (BUTTON)

   Note that you have to include the new evidence but (because of the
   stateless nature of /diagnosis) still keep the other data (including
   sex, age and initial evidence).

   You can continue this process: ask a question, accept an answer from
   the user, append new evidence to the list, make a request to
   /diagnosis. Each time the API will reply with an updated condition
   rankings and another question to ask.

Stop recommendation

   If should_stop is true, the stop condition has been reached. False
   means that the interview should be continued. If the attribute is not
   available at all, it means that either you haven't specified the
   initial evidence or that the stop recommendation could not be proposed.
   You can find more information about the stop recommendation and
   available interview modes on the [81]Diagnosis page.

Results

   When your stop condition is met, you may use the condition rankings
   that were returned from your last call to /diagnosis to obtain more
   information about each condition (such as its severity, acuteness, or
   advice for the user) by using the /conditions endpoint, or get an
   explanation of why a given condition was suggested by using the
   /explain endpoint (for conditions with probability >20%).

Next steps

   You should now have an initial understanding of how to work with the
   Infermedica API. Feel free to read the subsequent sections of this
   documentation for more detailed information about each endpoint, or go
   to our [82]GitHub (opens in a new tab) to see sample applications and
   libraries built using our API.

   Rationale

Rationale

   The /rationale endpoint enhances transparency and insight into the
   internal logic of the question selection process that determines which
   observation to ask about next. An observation refers to a [74]medical
   concept in our knowledge base, representing one of the patient's health
   parameters: symptom, risk factor, or lab test. Once the algorithm
   selects an observation, the /rationale endpoint can provide the
   reasoning behind that choice. The reasoning can then be displayed to
   end-users during the interview to improve their overall understanding
   of and confidence in the system.
   ¹

   Trial access to Infermedica API limits calls to the /rationale
   endpoint. [75]Contact us for more plan options.

Request

   The /rationale endpoint responds to POST requests and accepts the same
   JSON object as the /diagnosis endpoint.
   cURL
curl "https://api.infermedica.com/v3/rationale" \
  -X "POST" \
  -H "App-Id: XXXXXXXX" \
  -H "App-Key: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Interview-ID: d083e76f-3c29-44aa-8893-587f3691c0c5" \
  -d '{
        "age" : {"value": 25},
        "evidence" : [
            {
                "choice_id" : "present",
                "id" : "s_44"
            }
        ],
        "sex" : "female"
  }'

   (BUTTON)

   The example above describes the case of a 25-year-old female patient
   who has already reported joint pain (represented here by symptom s_44).

Extras

   The extras attribute found in the /diagnosis endpoint is also available
   with /rationale. For more information, see [76]Extras.

Response

   Rationale is an object comprised of the following attributes:
     * type: string - a well defined code (r0-r6)
     * observation_params: list[string] - a list of observation IDs,
       relevant to prioritizing a question
     * condition_params: list[string] - a list of condition IDs, relevant
       to prioritizing a question

   The response is represented by a JSON object that uses the previously
   mentioned data model.
   JSON
{
    "type": "r6",
    "observation_params": [
        {
            "id": "s_44",
            "name": "Joint pain",
            "common_name": "Joint pain"
        }
    ],
    "condition_params": []
}

   (BUTTON)

   This response indicates that the question asked by the algorithm is an
   important observation directly related to one of the pieces of evidence
   already provided. In this case - to joint pain.

Types of rationale

   The different rationale types are as follows:
     * r0 - Current question has the highest inferred statistical
       relevance. Returned possible values include:
          + observation_params - a one-element list containing the
            observation in question
          + condition_params - all of the rankings conditions that are
            related to the observation in question
     * r1 - Current question is based on a custom rule that's been used to
       refine the algorithm. This will be one of four variants:
          + the observation is both considered important by our medical
            experts and has a sufficiently high inferred relevance.
            Returned possible values include:
               o observation_params - a one-element set, the observation
               o condition_params - empty
          + the observation is crucial for the improvement of confidence
            in several key conditions. Returned possible values include:
               o observation_params - empty
               o condition_params - the set of conditions that more
                 confidence is needed for
          + the observation is a child node of another relevant
            observation and has a sufficiently inferred relevance value.
            Returned possible values include:
               o observation_params - a one-element set, the parent
                 observation of the prioritized observation
               o condition_params - empty
     * r2 - Current question is about one of a few pre-defined "key

   Engine API
   Build your solution
   Search

Search

   The /search endpoint helps find [75]medical concepts (symptoms, risk
   factors, and conditions) that match a given phrase. In contrast to the
   /parse endpoint, the /search endpoint can handle short word fragments,
   even those just a few letters long, and is suitable for building
   autocomplete-like input forms. Its main function is to convert
   user-entered phrases into specific medical concept IDs recognized by
   our API.

   Apart from the [76]common attributes name and common_name, /search also
   has access to a database that has two types of synonyms - ones used by
   the medical community and ones used by regular users. This enhances its
   capability to correctly recognize a broader range of user-entered
   phrases.
   ¹

   Unlike the /parse endpoint, /search supports all [77]languages
   available in the Infermedica API.

Request

   The /search endpoint responds to GET requests and requires two query
   parameters:
     * phrase - the phrase to be matched against medical concepts.
     * age.value - the patient's age, which should be a positive integer
       between 0 and 130.

   An optional age.unit query parameter can also be added to change the
   default unit from year to month. For example,
   age.value=5&age.unit=month indicates an age of 5 months. If age.unit is
   omitted, the default unit of year will be used.

Filtering by sex

   An optional sex parameter can be used to filter the search results for
   concepts applicable to a selected biological sex. The allowed values
   are female or male.

   For example, use /v3/search?phrase=lacta&age.value=30&sex=female to
   show only those medical concepts relevant for one biological sex.

Filtering by concept type

   By default, the /search endpoint only returns observations (symptoms
   and risk factors). You can use the optional types parameter to specify
   a comma-separated list of medical concept types to be included in the
   search results. The supported types are condition, symptom, and
   risk_factor.

   For example, to search for both symptoms and conditions, you could use
   /v3/search?phrase=influ&age.value=30&types=symptom,condition.

Filtering out professional observations

   An optional include_pro parameter can be used to include or exclude
   professional observations from the search results. Professional
   observations refer to symptoms or risk factors that are difficult for
   individuals without medical training to self-assess accurately as they
   require specific knowledge or diagnostic tools to identify. These
   complex observations are not used in patient-facing interviews and they
   do not have questions assigned to them.

   By default, the include_pro parameter is set to true, which means
   professional observations are included in the search results. To
   exclude these observations and only return concepts suitable for
   patient self-assessment, the include_pro parameter can be set to false.

   For example, to exclude professional observations from the search
   results, use /v3/search?phrase=sign&age.value=30&include_pro=false.

Response

   The response is a JSON list of objects, each containing two attributes:
     * id - the ID of the medical concept,
     * label - the actual value that matched the phrase. This can be a
       value of either the name or common_name attributes, or one of their
       synonyms.
