   Diagnosis

Diagnosis

   The /diagnosis endpoint is the core of the Infermedica API. Using a
   patient's sex, age, and medical evidence (including symptoms and risk
   factors), it suggests possible causes and generates questions to drive
   an interview similar to one a doctor would have with a patient.
   !!!

   The /diagnosis endpoint in the API is not a substitute for independent
   medical advice nor does it offer a diagnosis per se. The information
   presented by Infermedica's API should not be considered medical advice.
   The API is not intended or designed to be used to diagnose, treat,
   cure, or prevent any disease. The information that Infermedica's API
   provides should not be used for therapeutic purposes or as a substitute
   for a health professional's advice.

Stateless API

   The Infermedica API is stateless. Since the API does not track the
   state or progress of interviews, each request to /diagnosis must
   contain all the information gathered to that point about a given case.
   You can't send only the answer to the most recent question returned
   from /diagnosis; your application must store sex, age, initial
   evidence, and all previous answers, and resend them each time, along
   with the most recent answer.

Interview flow

   To carry out a symptom assessment interview with a patient, you will
   need multiple calls to /diagnosis. Before the first request, the
   patient's sex, age, and initial evidence must be collected (e.g. the
   patient's chief complaint and relevant risk factors). The response to
   the first request will contain an interview question that should be
   presented to the patient. The patient's answer should then be added to
   the list of already collected evidence. The process should continue in
   the following manner:
     * send a request to /diagnosis with the updated evidence list,
     * ask the patient the question returned from /diagnosis,
     * add the patient's answer to the existing evidence list,
     * repeat the steps.

   This process can continue for as long as necessary. The should_stop
   attribute suggests when the interview should be considered finished.
   Our engine takes into account several factors when determining this,
   including the interview length and the confidence it has in the
   rankings. It's possible to continue the interview beyond this point if
   needed, but we highly recommend honoring this attribute for most
   use-cases. In general, the number of questions answered and the
   probability of the top conditions in the rankings should be considered
   when deciding when to stop the interview.

Request

   The /diagnosis endpoint responds to POST requests containing a JSON
   object that describes a single medical case, e.g.
   cURL
curl "https://api.infermedica.com/v3/diagnosis" \
  -X "POST" \
  -H "App-Id: XXXXXXXX" \
  -H "App-Key: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" \
  -H "Interview-Id: d083e76f-3c29-44aa-8893-587f3691c0c5" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "sex": "female",
    "age": {
      "value": 25
    },
    "evidence": [
      {"id": "s_47", "choice_id": "present", "source": "initial"},
      {"id": "s_22", "choice_id": "present", "source": "initial"},
      {"id": "p_81", "choice_id": "absent"}
    ]
  }'

   (BUTTON)

Sex and age

   The sex and age attributes are two required elements of every request
   to /diagnosis. Under the hood, sex and age are used to automatically
   instantiate corresponding risk factors that may alter the base
   prevalence of medical conditions in Infermedica's model.

   The sex attribute indicates the patient's biological sex and can have
   one of two possible values: female or male.

   The age is composed of two attributes:
     * age.unit - optional parameter:
          + It can be either year or month,
          + If not specified, it defaults to year,
          + If age is provided in months, specifying age.unit as month is
            required. This is especially important for children under 1
            year of age, where age must be provided in months.
     * age.value - required parameter:
          + If age.unit is year, provide a value between 1 and 130,
          + If age.unit is month, provide a value between 0 and 1560.

   JSON
"sex": "female",
"age": {
    "value": 11,
    "unit": "month"
}

   (BUTTON)

   If age.value is missing, invalid, or set to 0 when age.unit is year (or
   not specified), you will get a 400 Bad Request [106]error.

Evidence

   The evidence list is the most important part of each request to
   /diagnosis. While evidence is technically an optional attribute, to
   receive a non-empty response there must be at least one present symptom
   added to your evidence list. Please note that sending only risk factors
   or only absent symptoms might not be sufficient to start the interview.

   Each piece of evidence should be sent as a simple JSON object with two
   required attributes: id and choice_id. Optionally, a source attribute
   can also be added (see corresponding section below).
   JSON
"evidence": [
  {"id": "s_98", "choice_id": "present"}
]

   (BUTTON)

   The id attribute indicates an observed symptom or risk factor.

   The choice_id attribute represents the state of given evidence and can
   have one of 3 values: present, absent or unknown. Please note that
   absent and unknown cannot be used interchangeably, as their
   mathematical meanings are different.

   Omitting id or choice_id or providing invalid values will yield a 400
   Bad Request [107]error .

Indicating evidence source

   Another key important attribute of evidence is called source. It allows
   the user to mark the exact stage of the interview that the given
   evidence was sent at. Thanks to this, the engine can provide more
   relevant interviews and, as a result, a better final list of most
   probable conditions as well as improved triage recommendations.

   We highly recommend adding the source attribute if any of the following
   applies to your case:
     * any symptoms are reported by user as initial evidence (see:
       [108]Gathering initial evidence),
     * any questions about symptoms or risk factors are prompted or
       predefined (see: [109]Common risk factors),
     * /suggest endpoint is used,
     * /red_flags endpoint used.

   !!!

   Keep in mind that, while the source attribute is not strictly required
   to get a response from the /diagnosis endpoint, setting it properly is
   required for the interview as a whole to function properly. source is
   also needed for Infermedica to be able to help with an implementation.
   As such, it is best to treat the source attribute as though it were
   required.

   This attribute takes one of the following values:
     * "source": "initial" - evidence reported by user,
     * "source": "suggest" - evidence from /suggest endpoint,
     * "source": "predefined" - evidence predefined separately from the
       dynamic interview, should be applied to all custom evidence (not
       calculated in /diagnosis or /suggest),
     * "source": "red_flags" - evidence from /suggest with red_flags
       method or /red_flags endpoint,
     * no value - for evidence gathered during the dynamic interview, the
       source attribute should be entirely omitted.

   For example:
   JSON
{
  "sex": "female",
  "age": {
    "value": 45
  },
  "evidence": [
    {
      "id": "s_21",
      "choice_id": "present",
      "source": "initial"
    },
    {
      "id": "s_156",
      "choice_id": "present",
      "source": "suggest"
    },
    {
      "id": "p_264",
      "choice_id": "present",
      "source": "suggest"
    },
    {
      "id": "p_13",
      "choice_id": "present",
      "source": "predefined"
    },
    {
      "id": "s_1193",
      "choice_id": "present"
    }
  ]
}

   (BUTTON)
   !!!

   An evidence source is required for every piece of evidence that was not
   inferred in /diagnosis, otherwise the quality of the interview could be
   strongly decreased.

Gathering initial evidence

   Interviews are most effective when they are started with some
   meaningful initial evidence. The search space of available symptoms is
   very wide, so the statistical inference engine needs a place to start.
   Due to this, you should aim for at least 2-3 initial present symptoms.
   Adding additional symptoms, as well as absent ones, and risk factors is
   also helpful.

   There are many ways to gather initial evidence:
     * using the [110]/search endpoint to implement autocomplete widgets
       that let users enter and select their observations,
     * using the [111]/parse endpoint to analyze free-text (either
       pre-existing, like a patient record, or entered by the user, like a
       chat message) and extract mentions of observations from it,
     * building a predefined list of [112]common or particularly relevant
       observations for users to choose from,
     * building a human body avatar with each body part mapped to the
       predefined list of observations for the user to select,
     * using the [113]/suggest endpoint to find observations that have
       often been selected by other users with similar health problems,
     * allowing users to enter their laboratory test results.

   Based on our experience from numerous deployments, it is both important
   and challenging to design this initial step in a way that will
   encourage users to provide enough data to begin the interview.

Indicating initial evidence

   The initial evidence, i.e. evidence reported by the user before the
   start of the interview, should be marked as "source": "initial", e.g.
   JSON
"evidence": [
  {"id": "s_98", "choice_id": "present", "source": "initial"}
]

   (BUTTON)

   There are two consequences of marking evidence as initial:
     * The inference engine can better understand the progress of the
       interview, which supports the [114]stop recommendation feature
     * Conditions unrelated to the initial evidence are only included in
       the conditions ranking when their probability is sufficiently high.
       This makes the interview results more focused on the chief
       complaints.

   In most cases, the initial evidence reported by a patient is related to
   the conditions in the rankings. However, we've noticed that some users
   provide initial evidence but later deny all of its related symptoms,
   causing the engine to broaden its search space and return unrelated
   conditions. Designating evidence as initial prevents this.

   Although there are use cases where it is impossible to use the
   "source": "initial" attribute, and it is therefore optional, we highly
   recommend using this attribute whenever possible, especially if you are
   relying on stop recommendations.

Common risk factors

   In our medical knowledge base, risk factors can be chronic conditions
   (e.g. diabetes), lifestyle habits (e.g. smoking), geographical
   locations (e.g. South America) or events (e.g. a head injury or insect
   bite). Risk factors alone are not sufficient information to start an
   interview, but their presence may greatly impact the base prevalence of
   various conditions. For example, if a patient reports a high fever and
   chills, it's most likely the flu. However, if the same symptoms are
   present but we know that the patient has recently returned from some
   exotic location, the engine will broaden its search towards infectious
   tropical diseases. Similarly, when a patient reports a headache, it is
   important to know if they have recently suffered an injury or trauma.

   Although /diagnosis may return questions about risk factors, when
   implementing a symptom checker we recommend asking the patient about
   common risk factors before the actual interview begins. This helps to
   steer the interview in the right direction and to reduce its length.

   One way to gather initial risk factors is to use [115]/suggest in
   relevant risk factors mode. This is recommended when working with
   [116]demographic-based risk factors or [117]evidence-based risk
   factors. However, some risk factors are not handled by the /suggest
   algorithm, notably those related to geographical location (either
   residence in or recent travel to):
     * p_13 - United States or Canada
     * p_14 - Central or South America
     * p_15 - Europe
     * p_16 - Northern Africa
     * p_17 - Central Africa
     * p_18 - Southern Africa
     * p_19 - Australia or Oceania
     * p_20 - Russia, Kazakhstan, or Mongolia
     * p_21 - Middle East
     * p_236 - Asia excluding Middle East, Russia, Kazakhstan and Mongolia

   As geographical risk factors (which can substantially improve the
   quality of an interview and its results) can only ever be gathered via
   the addition of extra pre-interview risk factor questions, it is
   strongly encouraged to add these to the application.

   Every piece of evidence which is not gathered with API methods (e.g.
   /search, /parse, /suggest, or /diagnosis), should be marked with
   "source": "predefined", e.g.
   JSON
"evidence": [
  {"id": "p_13", "choice_id": "present", "source": "predefined"},
  {"id": "p_14", "choice_id": "present", "source": "predefined"},
  {"id": "p_19", "choice_id": "present", "source": "predefined"}
]

   Hardcoding should be used sparingly. Overuse of hardcoding could lead
   to unforeseen errors, code duplication, and other maintenance issues.

Weight and height

   The previous version of the Infermedica API allowed weight and height
   to be sent along with sex and age. This is no longer supported, but
   weight-related risk factors are available in our default model and can
   be included as evidence instead. There are two such risk factors:
     * p_6 - Low BMI
     * p_7 - High BMI

   When a patient's weight and height are available, you can compute their
   [118]BMI (opens in a new tab) in your application and add the
   appropriate risk factor as present to the evidence list in a /diagnosis
   call, e.g.
   JSON
{
  "sex": "male",
  "age": {
    "value": 45
  },
  "evidence": [
    {"id": "p_7", "choice_id": "present"}
  ]
}

   (BUTTON)

   When the patient's BMI falls within a healthy range (between 19 and
   30), you may include both of the above risk factors as absent.
   Otherwise /diagnosis may return a question about BMI when such
   information would be relevant in the symptom assessment process.

Request extras

   The extras attribute may contain additional options that control
   various aspects of the endpoint. Please refer to [119]the section below
   for a detailed explanation.

Response

   The response contains 5 sections:
     * question - next interview question to ask the patient
     * conditions - ranking of possible medical conditions
     * should_stop - signals when to stop the interview (optional - this
       attribute will be returned only if initial evidence is indicated)
     * has_emergency_evidence - indicates if reported evidence appears
       serious and the patient should go to an emergency department
     * extras - usually empty, may contain additional or experimental
       attributes.

Question

   The question attribute represents an interview question that can be
   presented to the user.

   The question attribute can also have a null value. This means that
   either no present symptom has been provided as initial evidence or, in
   the rare case of an extremely long interview, that there are no more
   questions to be asked.

Question types

   There are three main types of questions enabled by default, with each
   requiring slightly different handling. A fourth can be enabled via the
   [120]enable_symptom_duration option.

single

   The single type represents simple Yes/No/Don't know questions, e.g.
   JSON
"question": {
  "type": "single",
  "text": "Does the pain increase when you touch or press on the area around you
r ear?",
  "items": [

          "id": "unknown",
          "label": "Don't know"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "extras": {}
}

   (BUTTON)

   When the user answers a question of the single type, exactly one object
   with the id of the item and selected choice_id should be added to the
   evidence list of the next request, e.g.
   JSON
"evidence": [
  ...
  {"id": "s_476", "choice_id": "present"}
]

   (BUTTON)

group_single

   The group_single type represents questions about a group of related but
   mutually exclusive symptoms, of which the patient should choose exactly
   one, e.g.
   JSON
"question": {
  "type": "group_single",
  "text": "What is your body temperature?",
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "s_99",
      "name": "Between 99.5 and 101 °F (37 and 38 °C)",
      "choices": [
        {
          "id": "present",
          "label": "Yes"
        },
        {
          "id": "absent",
          "label": "No"
        },
        {
          "id": "unknown",
          "label": "Don't know"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "s_100",
      "name": "Above 101 °F (38 °C)",
      "choices": [
        {
          "id": "present",
          "label": "Yes"
        },
        {
          "id": "absent",
          "label": "No"
        },
        {
          "id": "unknown",
          "label": "Don't know"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "extras": {}
}

   (BUTTON)
   !!!

   For a question of the group_single type, exactly one object with the id
   of the selected item and choice_id set to present should be added to
   the evidence list of the next request, with all other items omitted,
   e.g.
   JSON
"evidence": [
  ...
  {"id": "s_99", "choice_id": "present"}
]

   (BUTTON)

group_multiple

   The group_multiple type represents questions about a group of related
   symptoms where any number of them can be selected, e.g.
   JSON
"question": {
  "type": "group_multiple",
  "text": "How would you describe your headache?",
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "s_25",
      "name": "Pulsing or throbbing",
      "choices": [
        {
          "id": "present",
          "label": "Yes"
        },
        {
          "id": "absent",
          "label": "No"
        },
        {
          "id": "unknown",
          "label": "Don't know"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "s_604",
      "name": "Feels like \"stabbing\" or \"drilling\"",
      "choices": [
        {
          "id": "present",
          "label": "Yes"
        },
        {
          "id": "absent",
          "label": "No"
        },
        {
          "id": "unknown",
          "label": "Don't know"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "s_23",
      "name": "Feels like pressure around my head",
      "choices": [
        {
          "id": "present",
          "label": "Yes"
        },
        {
          "id": "absent",
          "label": "No"
        },
        {
          "id": "unknown",
          "label": "Don't know"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "extras": {}
}

   (BUTTON)
   !!!

   An object should be added to the evidence list of the next request for
   each item of a group_multiple question. Any available choice_id is
   allowed. Omitting any item may cause the same question to be returned
   by the API again.

Question extras

   Questions can be configured by using [121]extra request options. For
   instance, it's possible to [122]disable sensitive content or
   [123]question groups, [124]add additional explanations, or change to
   [125]third-person mode. Selecting a different [126]interview mode can
   change which questions are asked during the interview.

Conditions

   Each response contains a conditions attribute holding a list of
   possible conditions sorted by their estimated probability.

   Each condition in the rankings is represented by a JSON object with the
   following attributes: id, name, name_common, and probability.

   While name and common_name attributes are returned for convenience, any
   additional information about a given condition can be retrieved from
   the /conditions/{id} [127]endpoint using the id attribute.
   Alternatively, you can pass [128]include_condition_details in extras to
   include condition details in the /diagnosis response.

   The probability attribute is a floating point number between 0 and 1
   indicating a match between reported evidence and conditions in the
   model.

   Please note that the condition rankings may be empty [] if there is no
   evidence or in rare cases where the combination of evidence isn't
   associated with any specific condition.

Ranking limiting

   To prevent reverse-engineering of our models, we limit the number of
   conditions returned from /diagnosis.

   Most notably, if the list of evidence is shorter than 3, only one
   condition will be returned. In the case of longer evidence lists,
   /diagnosis can return up to 20 conditions, depending on the probability
   distribution of the conditions in the rankings.

Patient Education

   For some conditions, patient education articles may be available, as
   shown by the has_patient_education attribute in [129]condition_details
   being set to true. Patient education articles are documents compiled by
   our medical experts that contain detailed information about a
   condition's causes, the usual diagnostic process, possible care methods
   etc., and can be presented to a patient to give them a deeper
   understanding of the conditions that are returned in the interview
   process. For more information, please refer to the [130]Patient
   Education section.

Stop recommendation

   Once enough information has been collected, the interview should be
   stopped. To help you decide when to stop asking further questions,
   we've provided the stop condition recommendation. This feature uses a
   heuristic algorithm which takes into account the number of questions
   asked and the confidence of the current analysis' results.
   !!!

   The stop recommendation will be available only if you indicated at
   least one initial evidence (see [131]Gathering initial evidence).

   If should_stop is true, the stop condition has been reached. False
   means that the interview should be continued. If the attribute is not
   available at all, either you haven't specified the initial evidence or
   the stop recommendation could not be proposed.
   !!!

   It is possible to finish the interview earlier if
   has_emergency_evidence is true even if should_stop is false. This is
   acceptable when the urgency of the case is sufficient for the end-user
   and quick treatment is needed. However, we recommend continuing the
   interview until the should_stop attribute is true to achieve the most
   accurate results regarding the list of most probable conditions and/or
   triage level. Please note that in some cases, even if
   has_emergency_evidence is true, the triage level could still be
   increased from emergency to emergency_ambulance.

Response extras

   The extras attribute in response object is empty by default, but can be
   used to return additional or experimental attributes for custom models
   or selected partners.

Extras

   Both the request and response objects may contain an extras attribute.
   In requests, extras may include additional or experimental options to
   control the behavior of the inference engine. These options can also
   influence other endpoints that accept the same request object, such as
   [132]/suggest or [133]/triage.
   ¹

   Note that providing invalid or non-existent options will not produce an
   error.

enable_symptom_duration

   This option introduces a new type of question and an additional
   evidence attribute to support specifying the duration of an
   observation. To enable it:
   JSON
"extras": {
  "enable_symptom_duration": true
}

   (BUTTON)

   This option introduces the duration question type, which differs from
   other types by replacing the items attribute with evidence_id in the
   question object:
   JSON
"question": {
  "type": "duration",
  "text": "How long have you had stomach pain?",
  "evidence_id": "s_13",
  "extras": {}
}

   (BUTTON)

   When responding to a duration type question, the answer should add a
   single object to the evidence list. This object must use the
   evidence_id value as its id and include a duration object, apart from
   the typical choice_id. The duration object consists of two attributes:
     * value - a required numeric value that specifies the duration,
     * unit - a required duration unit, one of: week, day, hour, or
       minute.

   JSON
"evidence": [
  {
    "id": "s_13",
    "choice_id": "present",
    "duration": {
      "value": 2,
      "unit": "day"
    }
  }
]

   (BUTTON)

   The enable_symptom_duration option also allows for the use of the
   duration object with initial evidence (observations marked with
   "source": "initial"). While this addition is optional, including
   duration information for initial symptoms can enhance the inference
   process and potentially shorten the duration of the interview.

interview_mode

   This option allows you to control the behavior of the question
   selection algorithm. The interview mode may have an influence on the
   duration of the interview as well as the sequencing of questions.

   Currently, the following interview modes are available:
     * default - suitable for symptom checking applications, providing the
       right balance between duration of interview and accuracy of the
       presented results,
     * triage - suitable for triage applications that prioritize providing
       a safe triage level rather than attaining the highest possible
       accuracy for the final list of most probable conditions. If
       accuracy is a priority, this mode should not be used. The interview
       process is also shorter in cases where a patient is suspected of
       having a condition that requires emergency-level support as the
       interview is then stopped and the results are shown right away.

   JSON
"extras": {
  "interview_mode": "triage"
}

   (BUTTON)
   !!!

   Interview modes can only be used when [134]5-level triage is enabled.

enable_explanations

   This optional functionality is designed to provide additional
   descriptions, enhancing user understanding of each question's meaning.
   JSON
"extras": {
  "enable_explanations": true
}

   (BUTTON)

   When enabled, explanations can be attached to questions or question
   items. For single type questions, explanations are added at the
   question level. In group questions, they are attached to individual
   question items. Two additional attributes are included at both levels:
     * explication - additional context or description of the observation
       in question,
     * instruction - a list of steps to confirm the symptom's presence.

   JSON
"question": {
  "type": "single",
  "text": "Does she have a fever?",
  "explication": "The most accurate measurement is rectal temperature. You can a
lso measure the temperature under the armpit or use contactless thermometers. Ho
wever, using the contact thermometer is more accurate. Follow the thermometer ma
nufacturer's instructions. A temperature above 37°C or 98.6°F is classified as a
 fever.",
  "instruction": [
    "Clean the thermometer using soap and cold water.",
    "For rectal insertion, apply a small amount of petroleum jelly to the end of
 the thermometer.",
    "Insert the silver tip into the anus or mouth.",
    "Hold the thermometer in place for 2 minutes, or as long as recommended by t
he manufacturer."
  ],
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "s_98",
      "name": "Fever",
      "explication": null,
      "instruction": null,
      "choices": [
        {
          "id": "present",
          "label": "Yes"
        },
        {
          "id": "absent",
          "label": "No"
        },
        {
          "id": "unknown",
          "label": "Don't know"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "extras": {}
}

   (BUTTON)
   ¹

   Explanations are optional and may not be present for every question or
   question item. In such cases, null is returned.

enable_third_person_questions

   With this option, the interview can be configured to allow users to
   answer questions on behalf of someone else. By setting this option to
   true, each question from the /diagnosis endpoint will be formulated in
   the third person. As interviews for individuals under the age of 18
   have to be performed by someone else, if the age selected is under 18
   then the questions will be asked in third person.
   JSON
"extras": {
  "enable_third_person_questions": true
}

   (BUTTON)
   !!!

   If the model in use does not support third person questions, a 400 Bad
   Request error will be returned with the message: "message": "Third
   person question not supported."

include_condition_details

   Enabling this option adds an additional condition_details object to
   each condition in the conditions list. This object contains attributes
   that have the same values and meanings as those in the output of the
   [135]/conditions endpoint:
     * icd10_code
     * category
     * prevalence
     * acuteness
     * severity
     * triage_level
     * hint
     * has_patient_education

   JSON
"extras": {
  "include_condition_details": true
}

   (BUTTON)
   JSON
"conditions": [
  {
    "id": "c_255",
    "name": "Tetanus",
    "common_name": "Tetanus",
    "probability": 0.3118,
    "condition_details": {
      "icd10_code": "A35",
      "category": {
        "id": "cc_16",
        "name": "Infectiology"
      },
      "prevalence": "very_rare",
      "severity": "severe",
      "acuteness": "acute",
      "triage_level": "emergency_ambulance",
      "hint": "You may need urgent medical attention! Call an ambulance.",
      "has_patient_education": false
    }
  }
]

   (BUTTON)

Advanced options

   The options listed below can be useful in certain use cases, but are
   generally not recommended as they may have a negative impact on
   interview quality.

disable_intimate_content

   This option is used to exclude "intimate" concepts, including those
   related to sexual activity.
   JSON
"extras": {
  "disable_intimate_content": true
}

   (BUTTON)

   There are several safeguards to ensure appropriate presentation of
   content tagged as "intimate". If disable_intimate_content is not
   included, intimate content may be returned in responses. That said,
   questions considered very sensitive in nature - especially those about
   sexual behavior - will still require the user's explicit consent. This
   consent is facilitated via the Consent to a sexual interview symptom
   (s_2652). Setting the disable_intimate_content option to true ensures
   that no content tagged as "intimate" is included.

   Please note that the criteria for what constitutes "intimate" content
   can change over time. For the most up-to-date information regarding
   this classification, we recommend contacting Infermedica.

disable_groups

   Activating this option configures the /diagnosis endpoint to return
   only single type questions, effectively disabling questions of the
   group_single and group_multiple types. This can be particularly useful
   in interfaces where implementing group questions is challenging, such
   as in chatbots or voice assistants. However, as a general guideline, it
   is recommended to keep group questions enabled for more accurate and
   shorter interviews.
   JSON
"extras": {
  "disable_groups": true
}

   (BUTTON)

Deprecated options

   These options are maintained for backward compatibility only and should
   not be used in new implementations.

disable_adaptive_ranking

   Enabling this option reverts to the legacy method of displaying the
   ranking of possible conditions, used before the implementation of the
   current adaptive ranking system.
   JSON
"extras": {
  "disable_adaptive_ranking": true
}

   (BUTTON)

enable_triage_3

   Activating this option switches back to the legacy 3-level triage
   system. For detailed information, please refer to the [136]/triage
   endpoint documentation.
   JSON
"extras": {
  "enable_triage_3": true
}

   (BUTTON)

Alternative use cases

   While an interactive symptom checker (e.g. mobile application, chatbot
   or voice assistant) in which the user is presented with a series of
   medical questions is the most recognizable use case, there are other
   valid uses of the /diagnosis endpoint.

   The /diagnosis endpoint can be used to provide context-aware decision
   support, e.g. when paired with /parse to analyze patient notes, or
   integrated into an EHR-like system to provide instant insights about
   possible causes or subsequent care steps. In such cases, only one call
   to /diagnosis is usually required, as all the evidence is known in
   advance and there is no direct contact with the patient.

   When /diagnosis is used with [137]custom models, there are even more
   possibilities. We've seen /diagnosis used to qualify patients for
   clinical trials, to assess the risks of post-operational complications,
   and to support operators of medical call centers.
