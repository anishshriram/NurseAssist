   Medical Concepts

Medical concepts

   Our API recognizes various types of medical concepts: symptoms, risk
   factors, and conditions. Symptoms and risk factors are observations
   used to describe patient health problems, and our API can suggest
   conditions as their possible causes.

   To interact with our API, you need to know IDs of medical concepts in
   our [86]knowledge base. We provide endpoints to assist in [87]finding
   these IDs, [88]extracting them from free-text, and obtaining detailed
   information about them, as detailed in this and following sections of
   the documentation.

Endpoints

   For each medical concept type, there are two REST-inspired read-only
   endpoints that support GET requests, returning:
    1. All concepts for a specific age group (e.g.
       /conditions?age.value=25).
    2. Details of a single concept, if available for a specific age group
       (e.g. /conditions/c_1?age.value=25).

   There are also two similar read-only endpoints that allow querying all
   medical concept types together (/concepts and /concepts/{id}).

Specifying age

   Age is a required parameter for both endpoints because it affects the
   list of possible medical concepts. Here's how to specify it:

   age.unit - optional parameter:
     * It can be either year or month,
     * If not specified, it defaults to year,
     * If age is provided in months, specifying age.unit as month is
       required. This is especially important for children under 1 year of
       age, where age must be provided in months.

   age.value - required parameter:
     * If age.unit is year, provide a value between 1 and 130,
     * If age.unit is month, provide a value between 0 and 1560.

   If age.value is missing, invalid, or set to 0 when age.unit is year (or
   not specified), you will get a 400 Bad Request error.

Common attributes

   Each concept is represented by a JSON object with several attributes.
   Some attributes are common to all concepts:
     * id - short and unique concept ID,
     * name - professional medical term for the concept,
     * common_name - alternative name in plain language. If common_name is
       not defined, the API returns name instead.

   Please note that endpoints returning a single concept (e.g.,
   /conditions/c_1?age.value=25) may provide more attributes than those
   returning a list of concepts (e.g., /conditions?age.value=25).

Conditions

   Conditions refer to diseases, and other medical disorders defined in
   our knowledge base. Each condition is assigned a unique ID that begins
   with the c_ prefix and is followed by an integer, e.g. c_26.
   ¹

   You can explore the list of all available [89]adult and [90]pediatrics
   conditions.

Endpoints

    1. The /conditions?age.value={age} endpoint responds to GET requests
       by returning the list of all conditions available for a given age
       group.
       cURL
curl "https://api.infermedica.com/v3/conditions?age.value=25" \

  -H "Interview-Id: d083e76f-3c29-44aa-8893-587f3691c0c5"
       (BUTTON)
    2. The /conditions/{id}?age.value={age} endpoint also responds to GET
       requests, but returns detailed information about a specific
       condition identified by the provided ID. If an invalid ID is
       provided, the endpoint will generate a 404 Not Found error.
       cURL
curl "https://api.infermedica.com/v3/conditions/c_26?age.value=25" \

  -H "Interview-Id: d083e76f-3c29-44aa-8893-587f3691c0c5"
       (BUTTON)

Attributes

   Apart from id, name and common_name, each condition has several
   available attributes:
     * sex_filter - filter indicating conditions only valid for one sex;
       one of both, female, male
     * categories - list of categories the condition belongs to (e.g.
       Dermatology or Gastroenterology)
     * prevalence - approximate estimate of how common the condition is;
       one of very_rare, rare, moderate, common
     * acuteness - comparative distinction between acute and chronic
       conditions; one of chronic, chronic_with_exacerbations,
       acute_potentially_chronic, acute
     * severity - approximate estimate of how severe the condition is; one
       of mild, moderate, severe; can be used together with acuteness to
       alert users, e.g. when an acute and severe condition is suggested
       by /diagnosis
     * hint - brief bit of advice for patients that recommends the steps
       to take if a condition is suspected (e.g. Please consult a
       dermatologist as soon as possible); may be null
     * icd10_code - ICD-10 code of condition; may be null

   Example of a JSON object representing a condition, as returned by
   /conditions/c_26?age.value=25:

Symptoms

   Symptoms refer to medical signs and symptoms caused by conditions from
   our knowledge base. IDs of symptoms start with the s_ prefix and are
   followed by an integer, e.g. s_962.

   In our knowledge base, symptoms are organized into a parent-child
   hierarchy. Each symptom can have a single parent symptom assigned, e.g.
   severe headache is a child of headache. Each parent-child relation has
   a type assigned to it. The type of each relation is provided as the
   parent_relation attribute and describes how the child symptom relates
   to its parent; e.g. the child may refer to a specific body location
   (e.g. lumbar back pain or back pain) or an exacerbating factor (e.g.
   abdominal pain increasing after a meal or abdominal pain).

   The parent-child hierarchy of symptoms plays an important role in the
   symptom assessment process:
     * reporting a child symptom automatically adds its parent symptom to
       the evidence list,
     * reporting a parent symptom as absent will inform the engine not to
       ask about its children.

       (BUTTON)
    2. The /symptoms/{id}?age.value={age} endpoint also responds to GET
       requests, but it only returns detailed information about a single
       symptom. If an invalid ID is provided, the endpoint will generate a
       404 Not Found error.

Attributes

   Like conditions, symptoms have several available attributes (including
   id, name and common_name):
     * question - question asking the patient to confirm or deny the
       symptom; may be null for professional symptoms, which are only
       intended for medical providers and are not used in patient
       interviews
     * question_third_person - question in third person form, asking the
       reporter to confirm or deny the symptom; may be null for
       professional symptoms, which are only intended for medical
       providers and are not used in patient interviews
     * sex_filter - filter indicating symptoms only valid for one sex: one
       of both, female, male
     * category - category of the symptom; currently all symptoms are
       assigned to the same category: Signs and symptoms
     * parent_id - ID of the parent symptom; may be null
     * parent_relation - type of relation with the parent symptom: one of
       duration, severity, character, exacerbating_factor,
       diminishing_factor, location, radiation , may be null
     * children - list of child symptoms (symptoms that indicate this
       symptom as their parent) and their relations with this symptom

   Example of a JSON object representing a symptom, as returned by
   /symptoms/s_962?age.value=25:
   JSON
{

Risk factors

   Risk factors represent a patient's chronic conditions (e.g. diabetes),
   lifestyle factors (e.g. smoking), geographical locations (e.g. Central
   Africa) and events (e.g. insect bite or head injury) that may modify
   the baseline probability of conditions. IDs of risk factors start with
   the p_ prefix (as in predisposition) and are followed by an integer,
   e.g. p_28.
   ¹

   You can explore the list of all available [93]adult and [94]pediatrics
   risk factors.

Endpoints

    1. The /risk_factors?age.value={age} endpoint responds to GET requests
       by returning the list of all risk factors available for given age
       group.
       cURL
curl "https://api.infermedica.com/v3/risk_factors?age.value=25" \
  -X "GET" \
  -H "App-Id: XXXXXXXX" \

       (BUTTON)
    2. The /risk_factors/{id}?age.value={age} endpoint also responds to
       GET requests, but it only returns detailed information about a
       single risk factor. If an invalid ID is provided, the endpoint will
       generate a 404 Not Found error.
       cURL
curl "https://api.infermedica.com/v3/risk_factors/p_28?age.value=25" \

       (BUTTON)

Attributes

   These are the attributes available for a risk factor (including id,
   name and common_name):
     * question - question asking the patient to confirm or deny the risk
       factor; may be null for risk factors that should be added
       automatically based on sex- or age-related risk factors
     * question_third_person - question in third person form, asking the
       reporter to confirm or deny the risk factor; may be null for risk
       factors that should be added automatically based on sex- or
       age-related risk factors
     * sex_filter - filter indicating risk factors only valid for one sex:
       one of both, female, male
     * category - category of the risk factor; currently all risk factors
       are assigned to the same category: Risk factors

   Example of a JSON object representing a risk factor, as returned by
   /risk_factors/p_28?age.value=25:
   JSON
{
  "id": "p_28",
  "name": "Smoking cigarettes",

Querying all concept types

   There are specific use cases where querying all concept types together
   is practical and efficient, as it eliminates the need for multiple
   requests to individual concept type endpoints. A typical example is
   displaying a comprehensive summary of a completed interview, listing
   all reported symptoms, risk factors, and potential conditions
   identified during the interview. To support these use cases, two more
   general endpoints are available - /concepts and /concepts/{id}.

Endpoints

    1. The /concepts endpoint responds to GET requests by returning a list
       of all available medical concepts.
       Please note that, unlike with other endpoints, the age.value query
       parameter is not supported here.
       cURL
curl "https://api.infermedica.com/v3/concepts" \
  -X "GET" \
  -H "App-Id: XXXXXXXX" \
  -H "App-Key: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" \
  -H "Interview-Id: d083e76f-3c29-44aa-8893-587f3691c0c5"
       (BUTTON)
    2. The /concepts/{id} endpoint also responds to GET requests,
       returning details for a single medical concept. If an invalid ID is
       provided, the endpoint will generate a 404 Not Found error.
       cURL
curl "https://api.infermedica.com/v3/concepts/c_1" \
  -X "GET" \
  -H "App-Id: XXXXXXXX" \
  -H "App-Key: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" \
  -H "Interview-Id: d083e76f-3c29-44aa-8893-587f3691c0c5"
       (BUTTON)

Filtering by types and IDs

   The /concepts endpoint supports filtering concepts by their types and
   IDs, using the types and ids query parameters, respectively. Both
   parameters can accept either a single value or multiple comma-separated
   values. The supported types are condition, symptom, and risk_factor.

   For example, /concepts?types=symptom,condition would return all
   symptoms and conditions, while /concepts?ids=c_1,s_1 would return a
   list containing only the concepts c_1 and s_1. These filters can also
   be used together; for instance, /concepts?ids=c_1,s_1&types=condition
   would return a list with the single concept c_1.

Attributes

   Both /concepts and /concepts/{id} endpoints return only a minimal set
   of common attributes, which include id, name, and common_name, as well
   as:
     * type - the type of the medical concept, which can be one of
       condition, symptom, or risk_factor.

   Example of a JSON object representing a condition, as returned by
   /concepts/c_1:
   JSON
{
  "id": "c_1",
  "type": "condition",
  "name": "Achalasia",
  "common_name": "Achalasia"
}
