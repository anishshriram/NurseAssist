   Engine API

   Search

Search

   The /search endpoint helps find [75]medical concepts (symptoms, risk
   factors, and conditions) that match a given phrase. In contrast to the
   /parse endpoint, the /search endpoint can handle short word fragments,
   even those just a few letters long, and is suitable for building
   autocomplete-like input forms. Its main function is to convert
   user-entered phrases into specific medical concept IDs recognized by
   our API.

   Apart from the [76]common attributes name and common_name, /search also
   has access to a database that has two types of synonyms - ones used by
   the medical community and ones used by regular users. This enhances its
   capability to correctly recognize a broader range of user-entered
   phrases.
   ¹

   Unlike the /parse endpoint, /search supports all [77]languages
   available in the Infermedica API.

Request

   The /search endpoint responds to GET requests and requires two query
   parameters:
     * phrase - the phrase to be matched against medical concepts.
     * age.value - the patient's age, which should be a positive integer
       between 0 and 130.

   An optional age.unit query parameter can also be added to change the
   default unit from year to month. For example,
   age.value=5&age.unit=month indicates an age of 5 months. If age.unit is
   omitted, the default unit of year will be used.

Filtering by sex

   An optional sex parameter can be used to filter the search results for
   concepts applicable to a selected biological sex. The allowed values
   are female or male.

   For example, use /v3/search?phrase=lacta&age.value=30&sex=female to
   show only those medical concepts relevant for one biological sex.

Filtering by concept type

   By default, the /search endpoint only returns observations (symptoms
   and risk factors). You can use the optional types parameter to specify
   a comma-separated list of medical concept types to be included in the
   search results. The supported types are condition, symptom, and
   risk_factor.

   For example, to search for both symptoms and conditions, you could use
   /v3/search?phrase=influ&age.value=30&types=symptom,condition.

Filtering out professional observations

   An optional include_pro parameter can be used to include or exclude
   professional observations from the search results. Professional
   observations refer to symptoms or risk factors that are difficult for
   individuals without medical training to self-assess accurately as they
   require specific knowledge or diagnostic tools to identify. These
   complex observations are not used in patient-facing interviews and they
   do not have questions assigned to them.

   By default, the include_pro parameter is set to true, which means
   professional observations are included in the search results. To
   exclude these observations and only return concepts suitable for
   patient self-assessment, the include_pro parameter can be set to false.

   For example, to exclude professional observations from the search
   results, use /v3/search?phrase=sign&age.value=30&include_pro=false.

Response

   The response is a JSON list of objects, each containing two attributes:
     * id - the ID of the medical concept,
     * label - the actual value that matched the phrase. This can be a
       value of either the name or common_name attributes, or one of their
       synonyms.
