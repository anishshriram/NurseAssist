   Rationale

Rationale

   The /rationale endpoint enhances transparency and insight into the
   internal logic of the question selection process that determines which
   observation to ask about next. An observation refers to a [74]medical
   concept in our knowledge base, representing one of the patient's health
   parameters: symptom, risk factor, or lab test. Once the algorithm
   selects an observation, the /rationale endpoint can provide the
   reasoning behind that choice. The reasoning can then be displayed to
   end-users during the interview to improve their overall understanding
   of and confidence in the system.
   ¹

   Trial access to Infermedica API limits calls to the /rationale
   endpoint. [75]Contact us for more plan options.

Request

   The /rationale endpoint responds to POST requests and accepts the same
   JSON object as the /diagnosis endpoint.
   cURL
curl "https://api.infermedica.com/v3/rationale" \
  -X "POST" \
  -H "App-Id: XXXXXXXX" \
  -H "App-Key: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Interview-ID: d083e76f-3c29-44aa-8893-587f3691c0c5" \
  -d '{
        "age" : {"value": 25},
        "evidence" : [
            {
                "choice_id" : "present",
                "id" : "s_44"
            }
        ],
        "sex" : "female"
  }'

   (BUTTON)

   The example above describes the case of a 25-year-old female patient
   who has already reported joint pain (represented here by symptom s_44).

Extras

   The extras attribute found in the /diagnosis endpoint is also available
   with /rationale. For more information, see [76]Extras.

Response

   Rationale is an object comprised of the following attributes:
     * type: string - a well defined code (r0-r6)
     * observation_params: list[string] - a list of observation IDs,
       relevant to prioritizing a question
     * condition_params: list[string] - a list of condition IDs, relevant
       to prioritizing a question

   The response is represented by a JSON object that uses the previously
   mentioned data model.
   JSON
{
    "type": "r6",
    "observation_params": [
        {
            "id": "s_44",
            "name": "Joint pain",
            "common_name": "Joint pain"
        }
    ],
    "condition_params": []
}

   (BUTTON)

   This response indicates that the question asked by the algorithm is an
   important observation directly related to one of the pieces of evidence
   already provided. In this case - to joint pain.

Types of rationale

   The different rationale types are as follows:
     * r0 - Current question has the highest inferred statistical
       relevance. Returned possible values include:
          + observation_params - a one-element list containing the
            observation in question
          + condition_params - all of the rankings conditions that are
            related to the observation in question
     * r1 - Current question is based on a custom rule that's been used to
       refine the algorithm. This will be one of four variants:
          + the observation is both considered important by our medical
            experts and has a sufficiently high inferred relevance.
            Returned possible values include:
               o observation_params - a one-element set, the observation
               o condition_params - empty
          + the observation is crucial for the improvement of confidence
            in several key conditions. Returned possible values include:
               o observation_params - empty
               o condition_params - the set of conditions that more
                 confidence is needed for
          + the observation is a child node of another relevant
            observation and has a sufficiently inferred relevance value.
            Returned possible values include:
               o observation_params - a one-element set, the parent
                 observation of the prioritized observation
               o condition_params - empty
     * r2 - Current question is about one of a few pre-defined "key
       symptoms" and is relevant for a condition that is sufficiently high
       in statistical relevance. Returned possible values include:
          + observation_params - a one-element set, the key symptom
          + condition_params - a one-element set, the condition that the
            key symptom is relevant for
     * r3 - Current question is about a mandatory observation for a
       condition that is sufficiently probable in relevance. Returned
       possible values include:
          + observation_params - empty
          + condition_params - a one-element set, the condition that the
            observation is mandatory for
     * r4 - Current question is about a risk factor that, depending on its
       state, may change the statistical relevance of the conditions
       significantly. Returned possible values include:
          + observation_params - a one-element set, the risk factor
          + condition_params - a one-element set, the condition the risk
            factor is most significant to
     * r5 - No longer used.
     * r6 - Current question is about the most important observation out
       of those directly related to the evidence provided. Returned
       possible values include:
          + observation_params - a one-element set, the source observation
          + condition_params - empty
